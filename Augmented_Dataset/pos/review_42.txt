By Phil Curtolo Mel Gibson (Braveheart) gave a captivating performance as the father of a young boy kidnapped in Ron Howard's ransom.
Gibson embodies Tom Mullen, a rich business magnate whose past actions come back to haunt him as a disturbed psychopath, played by Gary Sinise (Forrest Gump), and his group of bass voyeous kidnaps his only son for $ 2 million.
Tom and his wife, Kate, played by Ren√© Russo (Tin Cup) were invited not to inform the police, but they contacted the FBI.
A few minutes later, an elite team of agents led by Delroy Lindo (broken arrow) is in Tom's house and wiring each phone.
The intrigue seems average, like most of the other removal films that you have already seen, and it was nothing more than that.
It's about halfway through the film.
Suddenly, Tom goes to the Fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying: "It's your ransom.
But it's as close as you will never get there.
Instead, I offer this money as a reward on my head, dead or alive. "
At this stage, the plot was thickened and the unusually slow start of the film turned into an action film filled with suspense with superb waterfalls.
The last half of the film is very well done.
Another thing that carries this film are the superb performances of Gibson and Sinise, while they collide in a mind game on their cell phones for the most part of the film.
Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly commented on the subject: "It makes you ask you what the kidnappers did before mobile phones."
Before this film, Sinise played mainly "Good Guys", first in Mice & Men, then in Forrest Gump, and more recently, in Apollo 13.
But he was surprisingly diabolical and cold in his representation of a cop-gona.
Gibson, of course, was only Gibson, in a performance worthy of the Oscars.
Although most scenes are quite predictable, Ransom is a very entertaining and suspense film.
