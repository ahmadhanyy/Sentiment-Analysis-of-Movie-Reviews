The word "rest" in the title must be underlined because it is a film that lacks action scenes at all.
What is happening is more based on the development of the character.
The film begins in the middle of the life of four people: Nick, Beth, Carol and Sid.
What they did earlier is that for the most part did not allude.
Nick and Beth have a relationship and decided to go from Enfield, Arizona to Butte, Montana.
 (And I who thought that mound was pronounced slightly different ...))
Carol is Nick's ex-girlfriend and Beth's best friend, Sid is a painter-smokers who repaint their house before the new tenants entered.
Obviously, on the basis of a play, the problem with the film is that there is a lot to do.
It is not easy that Nick and Beth are in love with each other, the reason why Nick was dismissed from his work is not mentioned.
And why suddenly Nick decides to visit his parents remains a mystery, when he has not seen them for many years.
Located in a small (fictitious?)
The city in Arizona was a good decision, because it makes the film focuses on the four characters and not on their environment.
The name of the city is not important, it could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future.
Bridget Fonda is particularly impressive like Beth who finds himself in bed with Sid when her fianc√© Nick leaves her.
Not an actress with which I found interesting earlier or seen a lot of photos, but I will keep an eye on her in the future.
Interesting Trivia: it was classified in in the United States but evaluated 'Barntill? Ten' in Sweden which means that anyone at any age can see it.
