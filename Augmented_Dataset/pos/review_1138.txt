Eric Rohmer's "Pauline At The Beach" is one of these deliberately punctuated, but charming little foreign films in which much is not used in terms of conspiracy, but many arrives at the characters emotionally.
The film takes place for a few weeks of August on the coast of Normandy, and focuses on six different characters, mainly Pauline (Amanda Langlet), a sage beyond her years of 15 years that came for summerWith her older, Marion (Arielle Dombasle).

Own with a candy supplier (Rosette).
While Pauline looks at a stranger to what is happening between all adults, she forms a relationship with her with a young adolescent (Simon de la Brosse).

Instead, it is an image that simply observes its characters in everyday life, and surprises come from small character details. The film is quite speaking and slow, and it is therefore quite sure to say that this does notis not for those who are only a fan of action films, but who are a treat for viewers who often like to venture outside the big budget and see a good art film.
