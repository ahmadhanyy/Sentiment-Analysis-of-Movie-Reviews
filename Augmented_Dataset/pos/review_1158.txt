EK Simply, especially when you run a dance class with the Mantra, "One, Two, Three, Attitude!"
Sherry Stringfield, not identifiable under the big hair of the 70s, has taken her first concert on the big screen since she left "ER" as Rubell accountant, but she is criminalally underused.
As Steve Rubell with drooping eyes and drugs, Myers is worth the entry price alone.
When he does not play the life of the party, the actor of the former "Saturday Night Live" suppresses all the confidence of Rubell and Swagger to show a man trying desperately to fill his empty and unhappy life of exorbitbitance; C'is a moment worthy of pity when, while prelining to a bed of money and vomiting a particularly heavy evening, he tries to seduce one of his employees.
And while his performance is largely serious, Myers mixes empathy with a delicate wink of "Austin powers", thus keeping a global sensation of "54" - clairvoyant, larger than life and satisfactory,A little not like a disco giantboule.
