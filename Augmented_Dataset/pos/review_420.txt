Revue by Susan Granger on "Osmosis Jones" (Warner Bros.)
If the Farrelly brothers taught anatomy and physiology at school, no one would never make the class.
This story of hip and live action / animation begins as a monkey seizes a hard egg of Frank, a zoo goalkeeper (Bill Murray), who catches him, drops him, then swallowed up the contaminated song, explaining: "If it strikes and Ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds, you can eat it."
Like "Fantastic Voyage" (1966), the pseudo-science animation then takes over when the immune system of his body contacts traffic control while an ingested virus hits the digestive system: "Be alert for illegal organizations! "
Eager to correct "an error in evacuation of the stomach" that he made once, an arrogant, intelligent and courageous white globule (Chris Rock) declares: "It's a crime scene!"
And associates with a conscientious cold remedy for "Phi Beta Capsule" called Drixenol (David Hyde Pierce) to hunt and destroy the deadly virus "Red Death" (Laurence Fishburne) which is determined to take Frank in 48 hours, in beatenbolaand E.coli to a medical file.
Beware of mucus mudslides, Cerebellum Hall chaos and Booger Dam (Runny Nose), as well as Molly Shannon and Chris Elliot's comic turns, as well as the voices of William Shatner and Brandy Norwood.
Peter and Bobby Farrelly, as well as the writer Mark Hyman and the animation directors Piet Kroon and Tom Sito, turned their penchant for the coarse comedy, encompassing flatulence, purnical wounds and "FORPING A PIMPLE without license" Family filmfunny.
On Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "Osmosis Jones" is a severely imaginative, original explosive.
And perhaps, laughing, children will learn where to find their struggle, as well as nutrition and hygiene nuggets.
