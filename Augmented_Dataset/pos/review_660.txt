Synopsis: retired detective Jerry Black (Nicholson) is involved in the case of a murdered girl and promises his parents that he will find the killer.
He buys a service station on a road he believes that the killer takes, and he became friends with Lori (Wright Penn) and his young daughter.
While Jerry and Lori fall in love, can he do what must be done to make his commitment?
Review: At first, "The Pledge" seems to be just another standard, but well executed, the criminal drama.
That's anything but; in his last hour, he turns the corner and becomes a riveting and terrifying study of his main character, Jerry Black.
Penn is paying attention to all the external signs of the serial killer kind, but they are only residents of windows.
His interest here, unequivocal, is Jerry, a man so haunted by his commitment that he consumes the entirety of his existence.
At the beginning, we only see that in small clues; some of his habits change, for example, and he suddenly resumes smoking.
But then, when Jerry buys the service station and befriends Lori, the real extent of his mania is concentrated horribly.
Nicholson is fantastic, depicting black with a rare subtlety and an animus; the progressive descent of Jerry in the obsession is like a car wreck, a horrible thing to look at but impossible to turn away.
Penn also in love with good performance of support for a large part of the rest of its actors.
Only Eckhart disappoints as a replacement for Jerry, Stan; he never seems to be completely convincing, too much a tool of the plot.
Pennâ€™s management is amazing, each frame seeming to be dried up - water, perhaps, or mental health.
All this is built at an overwhelming and devastating culminating point which persists uncomfortably in the mind long after the lights of the house appeared.
