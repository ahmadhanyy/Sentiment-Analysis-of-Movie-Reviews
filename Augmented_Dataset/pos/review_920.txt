The ring is probably one of the most scary films I have seen for years.
But then again, I have always had this phobia horror films born in Asia.
I remember that when I was a child, I was afraid like hell with these floating ghosts with long hair and long hair wearing their euaugh white dresses.
The ring really brings these memories back and it grabs me long after the end of the film.
Unlike horror films from the West, I am almost used to gore and visual effects, so much so, they become rather proud today.
There is really no scary film for the West for a long time.
If you have something in mind, tell me.
This Japanese film is supposed to be based on stories written by "The Stephen King of Japan", which is also (I heard) televised above the air in Japan.
The film revolves around a mysterious video that will bring death to the person looking at it, a week before visualization.
A journalist and her husband, quite stupid, test the SO call the "urban legend" and end up having a week before meeting his destiny.
She and her husband then search for the origin of the videocassette, to go to the root of the whole curse with the hope of freeing herself.
The ring plays on the senses like no other horror film today.
Visual subtlety, minimum music and intriguing intrigue put the audience in an aura of suspense throughout the film.
Very well done indeed, in particular for a film which does not have a single trace of violence and blood.
Now, this is something that something as a budding horror director should consider looking for.
Just an idea of the visual power of the film, she is in Japanese and subtitled in Chinese; both, I don't understand at all (ok, I had a friend who gave me a ride before looking, butHe revealed very little!).
The twists and turns of the plot, leading to an unforgettable highest point (will certainly leave an impression on the public) will make you at the edge of your seat.
