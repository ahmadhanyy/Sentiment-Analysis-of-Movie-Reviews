Bruce Lee was an actor martial artist larger than life (and).
The uniqueness of Bruce (that is to say, the self-produced sound effects, etc.) and martial art and the apparently perfected physique were all well represented by the actor, James Lee.
The story is told from the point of view of his wife Linda where she put a lot of family and aside a practical side of the life of Bruce Lee.
However, you cannot prevent yourself, that, whenever the combat scenes are on, which he can do with his body and this attitude and a familiar character.
I also like the small pieces of perspicacity scenes on the life of Bruce Lee before becoming famous: scenes like Bruce practicing the pronunciation of English.
It seemed that he was not better than anyone.
Scenes like Bruce delivering Chinese cuisine such as a boy-one bike delivery through the American college by looking at the students (all white), the cheerlers and the athletes.
It seemed to have also wanted American dreams and hopes.
In conclusion, the film was well directed, it produced a realization of which was Bruce Lee, and actor James Lee looked so much to Bruce that you must remember that he is only an actor.
And the combat scenes were all excellent.
So go see him and enjoy the film.
P.S.Is you saw the film Imparded by Clint Eastwood, so the feeling of Dragon looked very much like the feeling you felt after the impulse.
