The central objective of "Welcome to Sarajevo" by Michael Winterbottom is Sarajevo himself, the besieged city, and its different effect on the characters quite unhappy to be stuck.
This proves the backdrop for an incredibly made story that turns off in a refreshing way of mythical contenders ("Peloton"), racial tumultuosness (the ridiculous "The Walking Dead") or a shade of Schmaltziness ("List de Schindler").
The two tracks, Stephen Dillane as a journalist and Nusevic des Émières as an Orphan with a good fate that cannot be identified, are extremely credible; not a moment with them implied false rings.
The question is not what went well.
The question is what did not work.
On the one hand, the film does not give a political overview of the war as it progresses (the characters of Dillane bring back an American plane which moves away from Sarajevo at the start, and that's it.).
The assortment of high-level support actors, ranging from Woody Harrelson as a Yankee journalist "in" alcohol and cigarrettes to Marisa Tomei as a noisy children or somech is unable to rise aboveThe sketch of their characters, although they endeavor.
The interrupted use of authentic war images hindered the rest of the film somewhat, that makes the fictitious characters seem helpless in comparison.
However, Winterbottom avoids Mawkishness through a flashy and frantic modification and an imaginative use of music.
And that's a plus, because he does not play with our emotions with a sentimental blandness.
He wants us to know that in war, no one is victorious.

The "The Sweet below" by Atom Egoyan is powerfully meditative that I have seen this year.
He explores not only the consequences of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety, with cold and amazing plans of the backdrop of this Mistfortune but also by telegraphing the feeling of devastation that has permeated the small town with a huge amount of dignityand respect for each and each affected soul.
Ian Holm as a dark and lonely lawyer requesting compensation for city dwellers, has a rare decency and restraint with lawyers, he is a lion for bad reasons: the pain of having lost his daughter (it is aDrugs which frequently calls it to begged for money for money) is reflected in the city.
And in some fascinating flashbacks, we see how it has lost its purity.
This is one of the most breathtaking outstanding sockets on the loss of innocence I have ever seen.
But the most astonishing part goes to Sarah Polly, the peaceful and benevolent girl who, unlike other characters, remains the most mentally stable during the past, the present or the future.
His ability to transmit hidden pain and unconditional love is the opposite, but almost revolutionary role that won Emily Watson an Oscar nomination for "Breaking the Waves".
The two women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident, but it is not until this moment that we really see, really, their love without words and omnipotent.
 "The Sweet Certed" however, is the film of Atom Egoyan and for the moment, it emerges as the final face of independent cinema.
After reaching global recognition with "Exotica" from 1994, "The Sweet Cired" makes him something that few in this industry can be called: an artist.
He intertwines time with delicacy and sees a soul with purity which is simply not common.
