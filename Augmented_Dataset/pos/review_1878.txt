The idea at the center of the Devil's defender, who is, so far, one of the three or four best films in 1997, is that whatever the decision taken, evil triumphs - God is a filou, Satan isA humanist- "the last humanist".
It appears in many forms and seduces many men and women - according to his own words, "vanity - by far my favorite sin".
Al Pacino plays this role with Relish and manages to chew delicious lines ("lemme givya a piece of wisdom inside God ...", "I have a million names ..."), like JohnMilton - Lediable.
The main idea - that he can appear as anyone, in any form (in this case, a man of Buisness), brings mainly to the Time Bandits Bandits of Terry Gilliam.
But the film is something else, something original.
Part of what makes it so well, it is that it never takes itself too seriously - it twists for morality, vanity, death and mistreatment of children, but does not try to become a studydeep from power.
This is a wonderful - arrogant, funny, stimulating reflection.
It is also entertaining.
There is no way that you can predict the end - it withdraws from itself, pulling out of the eye of the mind.
The final blow is more creative, more daring, more difficult, then everything that is in the cinema from the white sock in the Fargo de Coen.
The central themes are fascinating (sometimes recalling the turn of the james' screw, and the inhabitants of the house of Bly d'Oates), and the product that is built around it is really.
It is good to know that things like this are always in progress.
