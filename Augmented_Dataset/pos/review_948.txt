The Martians landed in this film Hillarous Tim Burton.
Before entering the cinema, I was initially a little nervous about what this film would be.
Many people said that this film was stupid waste, and there was no interest in all of this.
How bad they were.
I left this film much happier than before entering the cinema.
History concerns Martians attacking the earth.
Using shelves (Hourra!)
They generally wreak havoc around the U.S and other countries.
Nicholson plays the president who must try to stop the invasion, and also take advice on his officials in loops.
But, fundamentally, it is a load of sets showing the Martians destroying the earth.
The way people are killed by the Ray pistols is great, they are a hillla (and a slightly disturbing scene) involving a Martian, a crazy general who just wants to tie the extraterrestrials, (and ends up being crushed by an extraterrestrial foot) and a bloody final involving many extraterrestrial heads exploding.
But, above all, this film is fun.
The Martians are full of character, the performances are perfect, and the All Star casting helps make the film more pleasant.
The film is a million times better than the day of disastrous independence, and is a real tribute to the films of the invasion of the 1950s.
They are an excellent score of Danny Elfman, and a lot of laughter.
It must be the best invasion I have seen for a long time.
