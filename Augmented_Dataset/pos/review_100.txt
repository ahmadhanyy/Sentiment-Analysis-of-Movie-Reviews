Some may be disappointed with the matrix.
I'll tell you I was.
I sat there and I sat there and I sat there while waiting for something to happen.
Now wait, I know most of you loved it, and I don't say that I didn't like it.
What I say is that the first half was extremely slow.
Now, seeing the trailer, it makes you think that the whole whole film is a great show of special effects.
Do not be fooled, this film has a big story.
And large pieces of speaking moments.
But I admit the special effects and the game was above the peer, deserving the note above.
Ok now in history.
Well, it can take some time.
Ok first of all, our world in which we live now, is not the real world, in fact we live in a world generated by computer known as the Matrix.
A man played by Keanu Reeves is about to discover it, when is kidnapped and almost cajol√© to go to the real world.
He does it and discovers that he can do everything, be everything he wants to be.
But he must fight a bad guy "matrix jump", who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him.
Laurence Fishburne, her guide somehow plays her character as well as Keanu Reeves.
But I sat in the theater for more and an hour wondering where all the special effects were.
Yeah, there were in the first half but not enough.
The trailer for this film was really misleading for people to think it was a film loaded with special effects.
Now, for the second half, he is explosive and saves the film.
Some of the special effects and fights were breathtaking.
The sound, music and all the effects have been effective, and the last hour entertained us.
But with a duration of 2 hours and 20 minutes, this film is at least 40 minutes too much.
We would have liked a better "matrix", but I must say that I loved it and I was entertained.
