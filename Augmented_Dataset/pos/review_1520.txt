No, it's not a bad film, in fact it's so good to reach its goal, I actually wanted the film to end quickly.
Event = Horizon is not your banal science fiction film, I am sure that many of those who watched this will agree with me.
It is not even original in this sense, = and it borrows strongly from films like Alien, Hellraiser and even = Blade Runner.
The magic of this film lies in its unorthodox context and its methodical construction which makes it wonderfully horrible.
History brings us to the year 2050, where travel in space have since progressed = enormously.
The horizon of events is in fact a ship built for secret experimental purposes; it has the capacity to fold time and space = allowing it as itinerant distances are not accessible during the lifespan of the'man.
The ship disappeared as soon as it entered service = but after 7 years, it reappeared again on the orbit of Neptune.
A = The research and rescue team led by Miller (Fishburne) receives the task of checking the survivors of the event horizon.
The designer of the ship, Dr. = Weir (Neill) follows to satisfy his curiosity on what really happened to his ship otherly impressive technologically.
Event Horizon is a science fiction horror film, much more true for the word than saying, = Alien would never be.
While in Alien, the crew must face a = ferocious creature while being locked in tight spaces, in events, = the forces that go against the crew are indefinite but nevertheless so powerful= and horrible.
The story takes place slowly and the accumulation of suspense = is superb, to the point where I really wanted to say aloud = `Estere!
I can't stand that anymore! '.
There are more than enough pretty = to send your adrenaline to pump overtime.
History in itself is not = exactly something very exciting and also, the game is only at most, = means of most commercial standards.
Despite this, the essence of horror is = very well made in this film, thanks to its property at the rate = narrative tales, disturbing and some really bloody sequences = (which, moreover, was quite generously removed byour censorship = board). = 20
Director Paul Anderson (who made Mortal Kombat) and his team of creators = `` atmosphere '' did well to keep the horizon event within the limits of the term "horror".
This image did not succeed very well in the United States = at the box office most likely for the impact of the terror factor he has on most audiences; people will not see him again and few would recommend = their friendTo look at that.
Although on the face of it, the event horizon is = mainly molded for mass entertainment; many thrills, spills and suspense = to keep the public to the point.
However, the offbeat horror element that = transmits the public in the end is very disturbing.
My friend and I could = not tell us a word for a good time after having crossed the experience = "experience" of the Horizon event.
I guess it was just the immense feeling = terror that the film had thrown us.
Be warned, this film is not for the timid or for pure = Entertainment.
Be ready to be disturbed if you decide to watch = this film!
The event horizon is highly recommended = 85 = 85 but at your own = risk!
Good-Horror has embraced the big screen for a long time, and Horizon Event is one.
