After bloody clashes and independence won, Lumumba refused to comply with the Belgians, who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the Congo.
Their officers, in particular General Janssens (Rudi Delhem) in the Congo Army, caused rebellions, undermining Lumumba, who was indignant by the rape and murder of Belgian nationals.
With the construction of troubles, Moise Tshombe (Pascal Nzonzi) and the province of Katanga, which contained 70% of the country's resources, proclaimed secession.
Lumumba replaced Janssens, making Mobutu a colonel and made a pacification
Tour with Congolese President Joseph Kasa Vubu (Maka Kotto), but it was too late.
"When you want to drown a dog, you say that it has rage," prophesies Lumumba on his own fate.
Peck and Bonitzer do exemplary work telling a complicated story with a myriad of players, although they frequently succumb to the clich√©, in particular with regard to Lumumba's privacy.
Peck's script illuminates Banto sayings as "the hand that gives, rules" when Lumumba uses it with the American ambassador.
Peck's management is less guaranteed, with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television dishes.
He served, however, by his cast of Ebouaney in the title role.
Ebouaney is dynamic, radiating the fierce passion of his character for his people and his country.
Lumumba's intelligence and ability to develop strategies, even if it is stuck by insurmountable chances, receive life by Ebouaney.
Peck's subject and main actor raise his film above his mediocre production.
 "Lumumba" is a story that deserves to be told and Ebouaney's performance makes the tragedy feel personally.
