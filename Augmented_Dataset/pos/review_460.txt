Today, war has become a reality for me after seeing a projection of Saving Priivate Ryan.
Steve Spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production.
The public is thrown about the theater with the testimony of the horror of the war.
Please keep children at home because the R rating is for reality.
Tom Hanks is magnificent as Capt John Miller, who left for France during the Second World War to save and return to his house a soldier, soldier Ryan (Matt Damon) who lost three brothers during the war.
Spielberg takes us inside the head of these individuals while they are facing death during the horrible battle scenes.
Soldier Ryan is not for everyone, but I thought the time had come for a film like this.
The film reminds us of the sacrifices made by our fighters from the Second World War and women.
We must never forget them, because many have given the ultimate sacrifice, their lives so that we can live in freedom today.
For that, I thank them and for Steve Spielberg for having made a film that I will never forget.
The Academy will not forget Tom Hanks in April 1999, because another Oscar well deserved with being in Tom's position.
