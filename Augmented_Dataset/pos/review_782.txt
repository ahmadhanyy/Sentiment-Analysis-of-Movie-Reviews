Melvin Udall is a heartless man.
He spends his days inside his spacious Manhattan apartment writing romantic novels.
It also seems that Melvin will never change.
One day, he dines his favorite restaurant, and is a little too bad for his normal waitress (the only Waitstress which will serve it), Carol (played perfection by a beautiful and sexy Helen Hunt.)
She threatens not to serve him if he does not be silent about her asthmatic son. He is silent.
To worsen things, Melvin has an obsessive compulsive disorder.
One day, his neighbor of the Gay artist Simon (Greg Kinear, of Talk signs, in a role worthy of an Oscar) threatens to fire at the door of Melvon.

And through the dog and a rather heartbreaking car trip which implies Simon, Carol and himself, Melvin learns to emerge from his Caliva shell.
Jack Nicholson gives yet another performance of Caliber to the Oscars as cynical manager of the film, and is back to work, not playing a goofy U.S.Pres -president or a Villian comic, but playing Jack Nicjolson, and playing to playfull strength.
All of this is added to the funniest comedy of this year, a creative, spirit and scathing film by James L.brooks and Brooks obtains performances worthy of reward from the whole distribution.
A winner in all aspects and a truly delicious edge of cyncial life.
