This remake of "La Cage aux Folles" presents a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to draw wool on the eyes of the future of their son.
The couple (Robin Williams and Nathan Lane) are about also archetypal, or as the least nice could say it? Stereotypical, gays possible.
Williams has a nightclub featuring Drag Queens where his partner occurs as a star star.
They live above the club in what could not be mistaken as a heterosexual home.
Williams is excellent as it should not be surprising.
Gene Hackman as a right-wing potential stepfather is refreshing in one of her rare comic roles.
The real star is Lane.
His attempt to transform one of the most homosexual men in the world in addition to the uncle of direct shooting is hilarious.
It may be a personal failure on my part, but the high drama drama crying and screaming, just climbing on my nerves and the first minutes of this film are filled.
Fortunately (for me at least), it does not last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between men, their son and deception.
The question of stereotypes is delicate.
These guys personify the gay homophobic image.
You can almost hear swishining.
If you think they are supposed to be representative of each homosexual in the world, you will be indignant.
But if you can accept the opinion, it is because it is a film on gays, you will love it.
