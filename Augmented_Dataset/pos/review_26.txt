Synopsis: Bobby Garfield (Yelchin) lives in a small town with his widowed mother without joy (Hope Davis).
The world of Bobby revolves around his friends, in particular the Spty Carol (Boorem).
Then one day, a new resident arrives at Bobby's.
Ted Brautigan (Hopkins) is an enigmatic man to whom Bobby takes an immediate taste.
While the link between Bobby and Ted deepens, Bobby becomes aware of Ted's great secret, an event that will always change their lives.
Review: a little but enchanting film, "Hearts in Atlantis" easily recalls another film of king inspiration, "Stand by Me", both in terms of frame and feeling that it transmits.
 "Hearts" is a tribute to the magic of childhood, in these summers when the days do not seem to be heard, and nothing means more than your closest friends.
Unlike "stand by me", there is a supernatural element in "hearts", but although it is essential of the plot, it is not important.
Like "stand by me", it is a film mainly focused on the characters, and as such, it greatly benefits a superb casting.
Yelchin is very good as Bobby, finding a good mix of innocence and resignation.
More splendid is still Boorem, which I congratulated a lot for his work in "Lens Come a Spider" and which is simply radiant here as Carol.
And then there is Hopkins, who despite such a calm and introspective character that Ted nevertheless attracts our attention each time he is on the screen.
Davis is less effective, including Elizabeth, Stident appears to be too caricatured.
I also found it strange that the other friend of Bobby and Carol, Sully (whose death as an adult sets up the film's framing device of the film), makes no attention.
But the management of Hicks is charming without being disgusting, and despite the general lack of incident of the film, it continues to forge his fate to the public.
