Usually, when we discuss who is the modern queen of romantic comedy, they evoke names like Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock.
Others will mention Meg Ryan.
But for me, it's not even close.
Janeane Garofalo is not only the queen of romantic comedy, she is the best actress of Hollywood comics at the moment.
And it is a good thing that she plays in the contribution, because without her presence, the film would be bland, funny and dull.
Garofalo plays Marcy Tizard, a high -level assistant from the Boston senator, John McGlory, who suffers in the polls.
In an attempt to capture the Irish vote, he sends Marcy on a mission to a small Irish town called Ballinagra in search of other McGlory who has never moved to America.
Unfortunately for Marcy, his visit coincides with the city's annual matchmaking festival.
Things take a difficult start for Marcy.
She does not have hotel reservations (for no rational reason) and the small confined room (old tired snapshot ') in which she must remain a visitor in her bathtub.
His name is Sean, and Marcy finds him repugnant at first, so you can obviously say where it is heading.
The film comes up against a few roadblocks.
For example, the story is very thin.
None of the characters (except the old local interchange) is almost as interesting as Garofalo.
Some of the characters, such as the political assistant played by Denis Leary, wandered a completely different film.
I think the director realized and decided to throw many photos of the magnificent Irish landscape, and several close -ups of Garofalo's winning smile.
What is strange is that it works.
The charm of Garofalo and the Irish landscape could wear the thinnest stories, and it carries it.
