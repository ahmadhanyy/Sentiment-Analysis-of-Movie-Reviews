Like Mozart's big musical pieces himself, Amadeus is a real work of art.
One of those rare films of the 80s will be known for his class, style and intelligence.
Why is it such a good movie?
There are almost too many reasons to explain.
History: The legal composer Salieri (f.
Murray Abraham) feels waves of different emotions crossing his head while Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) enters his life as a young genius composer.
Salieri feels envy and jealousy, but at the same time is fascinated by the brilliance and engineer of Mozart.
We travel through Mozart's life as a composer, through his difficulties, his triumphs and, ultimately, his disappearance.
The game: Abraham is magnificent like Salieri; his range of actor allows him to focus on each individual emotion and to express it through his speech and his body language.
This performance earned him a well -deserved Oscar.
Tom Hulce is interesting as well as Mozart, an original and boring bratty child with boring laugh.
He is strong, but weak at the same time, and must be helped by his wife (Elizabeth Berridge), who is good in his role, but lack of dramatic depth.
Jeffrey Jones, in a smaller and more worthy role than such roles in Stay Towned and Mom and Dad except the world, is perfectly sunk because of his noble charm.
The film: Each element of this film works.
The costumes and makeup are very memorable, as well as its superb artistic direction and its unforgettable scores (adapted from the original music of Mozart).
While Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a music genius, Milos Forman proves with his film that he is a cinema genius.
This film is a classic that we will remember for the years to come.
