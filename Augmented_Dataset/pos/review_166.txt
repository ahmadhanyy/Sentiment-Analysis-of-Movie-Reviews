A big surprise for me.
The good trailer had suggested that they had managed the impossible, but making a Blues Brothers film without Jake Blues (John Belushi) is such a stupid idea that I really had no hope.
They replaced it very well.
Not with John Goodman, he didn't do much, but with the brilliant actor Joe Morton, who can really sing.
Blues' fourth brother is J Evan Bonifant, ten.
It was another of my fears for the film, but he is a very good dancer, and plays a wicked harmonica (although he may have been nicknamed).
Things that had already disturbed me, like no mission from God, everyone being richer, it is not filmed in Chicago - gave me no problem.
I am very happy that there are fewer cars piles because they meant less music, and John Landis seems to have lost all interest for the whole.
There are a few first accidents, then a huge accumulation, but after that, everything stops.
It's just music.
One of my problems with the first is that Cab Calloway's song is so good that the Blues brothers look dull after him, but there is no problem with this.
The music is still so good, tons of great musicians who arise - with the exception of Johnny Lang, who cannot sing, all musicians do an excellent job.
The only real problems I have were the special effects.
It was superfluous and a waste of money.
Since the film is not doing very well, they could mean that we have no possibility of another suite, that I want to see.
The Bluegrass version of Riders in the Sky is even better than Rawhide.
