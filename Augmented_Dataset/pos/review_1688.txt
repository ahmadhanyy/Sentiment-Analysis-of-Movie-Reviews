The small -scale film, in a limited version, "Waking Ned Devine" is a pleasant excursion for a moment and a place that allows the public to absorb the complete texture of a small town.
Filled with breathtaking landscapes, "characters" and delicious music, the film would be interesting even without intrigue.
The story contains several surprises that are better mentioned in a review.
The film begins with a clear opening, which gives us a taste of what is going to follow: the country folks with an inclination for a little lacin.
What makes things happen is the fact that a lottery winner is apparently one of the residents of the small town (Pop 52) in Tullymore.
Who is this person and how to share in good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends Jackie (Ian Bannen) and Michael (David Kelly).
The detectives in part, partly Scalawags, they must remain vigilant on the changing circumstances which they face as the story takes place.
The village consists of several fun characters.
A distraught pig farmer, a temporary priest and a witch.
There is also the Lotto Man which must be convinced that everything is on the assembly.
There are no Hollywood touches to this film - except for the introduction of space [!].
The pace is right.
Towards the end, it is a bit out of vapor, but it does not matter because during most of the 90 minutes, we were interested in obtaining.
A mixture of laughter and feeling (occasional) - all good emotions are engaged.
In a brief dream sequence - you will know it when you see it - a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters in a place where you really hope.
One of the key moments in the film.
Music, available on CD (London 289 460 939-2) follows the same arch as the film and deserves to be considered.
A beautiful film that is for everyone except action fans.
A bit like "the Englishman who put together a hill and descended a mountain" ...
But more alive.
