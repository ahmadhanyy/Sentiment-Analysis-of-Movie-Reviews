On April 12, 1912, the most surprising sinking in world history occurred.
On this fateful night, the Titanic sank.
Now, more than 50 years later, a film has been made.
And what a film that is to say.
James Cameron's new film is a benchmark in narration, emotion and special effects.
It starts in the present, where Bill Paxton and his band of scientists explore the depths of the ship's wreck.
Exploring an old breast, Paxton comes across a naked drawing of a young woman.
The drawing is televised and the woman (Gloria Stuart) whose portrait that the painting is to advance and slowly but surely, the story of the ship is told.
Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Jack Dawson, a young man with a sketchbook, a golden heart, a smart spirit and not much else. He wins his ticket on board the Titanic in a poker match andis the perfect match for Rose Dewitt Bukater (Kate Winslett).
She grew up to love Jack, but seems unable to escape the viscous claws of her arranged fiancé ”, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).
The film takes its time and, in doing so, makes us worry about its characters and shows us all the aspects of human emotion.
The tracks shine; there are no bad performances; in fact, they do not look like performance at all, but authentic people, trapped on the convicted ship, confronted with a certain death.
By watching this film, I was amazed to see how lively and real situations are: the time Rose and Jack spend a third party together; the naivety that Jack feels when he knows Rose Nude; the terror feltBy all on board, while some fate transform people into cowards and heroes.
This, the most expensive film ever made, 200 million dollars, is intended to achieve its profit, then some.
He also has more emotion and warmth than any other film this year ... even this decade.
This is also another first: the first romance of $ 200 million, and each criticism of this country will agree that it was indeed money extremely.
