In "Magic Town", Jimmy Stewart is in the form of a point to play a sounder that goes to a "perfect" city to assess their reactions on the types of problems that are concerned about surveying.
However, as time progresses and that he finds himself falling in love with the city (and a woman), he begins to see that what he does is bad.
The intrigue is standard, but it is not important.
In a film like this, it is the caliber of the actors who make it or break it.
Obviously, since Stewart features, it is practically a non-problem.
He's great in the film, as usual.
There is just something in him who always manages to be endearing, even when he deceives the people of the city.
You are still on its side, and you want to see all its goals come to the fruit.
The film was directed by a longtime screenplay by Frank Capra, and it is seen.
It is the type of well-being image for which Capra is famous.
As "the end" appears on the screen, everything was very well enveloped.
There are no loose ends, and almost all the characters get a happy ending (those who deserve one anyway).
In the era of cynicism, it is refreshing to see such an optimistic film.
 "Magic Town" is a deliciously entertaining film.
If you believe that all the old films are slow, you would be well advised to check it.
