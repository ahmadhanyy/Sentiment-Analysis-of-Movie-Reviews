Synopsis: an attractive dumb makeup maker, working on an ultra-cochered slasher film in Moscow, testifies to the production of a tobacco film
Meanwhile, the artist's sister and boyfriend tried clumsily to save her.
Comments: The silent witness surprised me the first time I looked at him.
Pulled by the smart illustrations on the video box, I rented the film while waiting for a complete turkey.
The silent witness, however, was original, offbeat and well done.
It is one of these cool little discoveries that no one seems to know.
I later found it in most of the videos' rental places that I visit, and we can see, on occasion, on the independent film chain.
The first hour of silent testimony is extremely tense, because Billy, the fairly credible silent heroine, sees members of the Russian crowd brutally kill a prostitute while turning an illegal tobacco film.
The rest of the film benefits well in Billy's vulnerable position as a silent foreign in Moscow which is chased by powerful criminal personalities.
To throw a curve ball into the fray, Billy's sister, Karen and her Beau-Cin√©ma, become bizarre figures of comic relief to compensate for several violent sequences in what really funny scenes are.
A disappointing end and occasional comic strip errors are the only two things that acquire this differently suspended film.
Look for Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi from the first Star Wars trilogy) in a small role as bad guys.
Certainly check this film; although, as a word of warning, it contains several scenes of rather macabre violence which are certainly not for the delicates.
