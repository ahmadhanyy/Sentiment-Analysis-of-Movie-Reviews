As a devout and believer Advances admitted to extraterrestrials, I have an idea of what Ellie Aroway feels (Jodie Foster).
But because my reasons not to participate in religion are different from its own, I cannot say that I do exactly.
Her reason is that she needs solid evidence: there is no evidence that God existed, so she does not believe.
Ellie also believes in extraterrestrials and has spent most of her life proving that they exist.
How can she say that she does not believe in God because of the lack of evidence, then says that she believes in extraterrestrials, who are very much less believed than God without looking like a hypocrite?
It's wrestling.
When star Vega extraterrestrials make them plans to make a device transport someone (okay, well, they didn't really * ...) ...)
Ellie wants to be the only one to leave, but because of her atheism, she is denied the post.
How stupid is it?
She discovers transmutions, then she is not allowed to leave.
Well, because of a bomb and a psychopath (Jake Busey), she * ends * by going, but not the way we would have thought.
Contact is based on a novel by Carl Sagan, who died during the cinema.
This is the best extraterrestrial film for narrow 3rd genre meetings, and will end up being the best film of the year.
His views of science and religion will undoubtedly worsen some, but will stimulate more.
I am happy that at least a film from the 90s can represent extraterrestrials under a psitic light, rather than a bunch of Slimey animals that will eat your interior and then put your body.
