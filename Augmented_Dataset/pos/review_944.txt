A costume drama taking place in the 1500s, in England, Elizabeth is a political and romantic political masterpiece about the upheaval of the crossing of a Protestant queen of a respected Catholic.
When the court and the country are a whole after the death of the queens, the royal family, so to speak, is upset that a Protestant is sung, and not another Catholic, in addition, the new queen, Elizabeth I (Cate Blanchette), was the bastard baby of the father of Queen Marie previous.
Persecution on Catholics and Protestants is not the only majority to Elizabeth.
Elizabeth I have to face the decision to abandon personal pleasures, and her lover (Joseph Fiennes of Shakespeare in Love), in order to successfully govern the country, which she made for 40 years more.
Elizabeth and Shakespeare in Love take place at the time of Elizabethian, and both present a Queen Elizabeth I (Judi Dench cheek in Love), or a course.
However, I found Elizabeth more stimulating and implying that love, not only because Elizabeth presents much more Elizabeth I, but because I found Blanchette a more powerful hypnotic sense for the role.
Elizabeth, with also Geoffrey Rush and Richard Pantaliergh, is my choice for the Prix for the Best Film of 1998.
It is a dynamic, important and breathtaking film of loyalty, of power, greed and confidence.
Shakespeare would die for the rights of the book.
