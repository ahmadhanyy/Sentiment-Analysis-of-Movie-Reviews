My American compatriots are a film which, at first glance, seems to have little substance (or a film that we have all seen a million times), two rivals for life thrown together, then the pleasure begins.
This is exactly what happened in this film, but fortunately, they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way.
The film begins with a quick look (and I mean quickly) of two presidents Russell Kramer (Jack Lemmon) and Matt Douglas (James Garner).
William Haney (Dan Aykroyd) and Ted Matthews (John Heard) are the new president and vice-president.
There is a scandal that occurs involving a bribes of an entrepreneur and Haney is certain that he buried years ago.
He finds a scapegoat in Kramer and now everyone wants Kramer and Douglas died.
This film was exceptional for many reasons.
One being that they found people (Lemmon and Garner) who have a good chest of time.
They worked very well as a unit and they reflected perfectly, one being a man of ladies and one being the old man (I let you be fiquor which is which).
In addition, they have found people who know their games well as government officials.
It seemed to me that Garner played almost exactly the same role he played in the separate gentleman (except that he was a member of the congress).
The experience has a lot !!
