A Robert Redford river crosses, it is not a film that I often watch.
It is a masterpiece - one of the best films in recent years.
Until 1994, it was my second favorite film of all time.
The actor and management are first -rate - never Sappy, always touching.
One of my friends reported once he had avoided it because "I was afraid that it was really politically correct and I'm checking myself."
Everything I could do was tell him to go to an impartial and enjoy.
It was one of the few films that completely reduced me to tears.
But some memories should not often be re -expressed - in the last plans, you should cry.
During my first vision, I left Bawling.
It is not impeccable - but it is so good, that you cannot help but be done.
The opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental - watching these photos of people who have died for so long, gives you a feeling of perspective and observation of the story that you will find in very few other films.
Martin Scorsese one day described films as a dream state - like taking dope and immersing you in an alternative world.
This is what a river crosses.
It exploits the unique power of cinema to absorb you and help you forget your real self.
The twice I saw it, it's difficult (once again to quote scorsese) which woke up.
But the dream is charming.
