The Revue de Susan Granger on "The Perfect Storm" (Warner Bros.)
 "More people die on fishing boats, per inhabitant, than working in any other work in U. S.
Each trip that a fishing boat makes can be a risk all or nothing.
It is life to its most exhilarating and the most terrifying, "explains director Wolfgang Petersen (" Das Boot ").
And this is exactly what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a sword fishing boat, the Andrea Gail, which came out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, in late October 1991.
At the start of Bill Wittliff's scenario, based on Sebastian Junger's bestseller, we meet the six crew.
The veteran captain (George Clooney) is frustrated because he does not find fish on the big banks, but a rival skipper (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) brings huge trips.
His right man (Mark Walhberg) needs money to build a new life with his friend of girls (Diane Lane).
There is a devoted father (John v. Reilly) with a distant wife and son, a Jamaican with a free spirit (Allen Payne), a lonely guy (John Hawkes) and a last -minute replacement with a bad attitude (William Fichtner).
The skipper is convinced that he can change his bad luck in a distant Flemish cap, and he does.
But then the problems start.
There is a vague thug, a man over board and the ice machine breaks - with 60,000 lb.
of fish that could spoil.
But it is a minor compared to a deadly monster storm approaching that a boston meteorologist describes as "a disaster of epic proportions" which also threatens the life of a rescue of the helicopter of the Coast Guard trying to saveThree people blocked on a sailboat on the high seas.
It is formulated and there are shots, but the walls of water, created by the dynamics of fluids simulating real phenomena, are great.
On Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "The Perfect Storm" is a terrifying and suspense 8.
Hang on for the summer chills ride from summer!
