The "Italian Hitchcock" and the recognized master of the murder of Giallo Dario Argento once again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula of Pheneomena.
This time, torsion is in the form of Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly), a brilliant teenager with a gift to communicate telepathic with insects.
Sent to a boarding school of girls in Switzerland, she soon learned of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least a murder which terrified the population of the school.
A fortuitous meeting with a brilliant entomologist (Donald Pleasance) leads the two to team up and to solve the mystery using his remarkable gift.
The phenomenon is an imaginative and original thriller.
The writer / director Argento creates several sequences of surreal and haunting beauty here, including an episode of sleeping sleeping and a striking scene where a swarm of flying insects descends to the school of Jennifer's Beckoning.
The plot takes wonderfully bizarre turns and the identity of the killer is really shocking and surprising.
The director made a big bet with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as the group of Heavy Metal Iron Maiden, the former Bill Wyman in roller stone and the favorite Gothic / electronic goblin of Argento.
But he moaned surprisingly well.
The opening music of the film was repeatedly reclaimed, a strange and evocative partition which perfectly sets the general tone.
Argento fans are wary: the film was released outside of Europe in a terribly massacred form rehabilitated like lianas.
This has removed almost half an hour from sequences, mainly of key dialogue scenes.
