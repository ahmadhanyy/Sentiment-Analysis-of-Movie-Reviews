This sometimes judicious and often in motion documentary extends the life and times of Anne Frank, the young diarist and the most famous victim of Adolph Hitler.
The writer / director / producer Jon Blair collected an astounding amount of historical equipment on Anne and the Frank family.
We meet Miep Gies, one of the protectors of the family who is still alive.
She tells how she found the newspaper in the days that followed the Germans who captured the Franks.
We look at Otto Frank, Anne's father and the surviving family member, in interview images filmed before his death.
Blair successfully combines these clips, sequences and other historical recordings to tell exactly what happened during this terrible period of European history.
As Kenneth Branagh told and with newspaper jumps read by Glenn Close, Anne Frank remembers Anne's story.
We meet and discover the * many * friends, family members and acquaintances whose life was touched by this young woman and her writings.
Winner of the Academy Prize from last year for the best documentary.
