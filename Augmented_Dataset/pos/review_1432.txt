Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:
I must admit that the single "new" of "New" is quite catchy.
It was bouncing and energetic enough to make me see this new film by director Doug Limon, the man who brought us the humorous swingers some time ago.
the result ?
A film that is as good as this song, really.
He follows the lives of several individuals during a weekend.
We first hear about a grocery bag (Sara Polley) which encounters a monetary situation problem and ends up selling false drugs in a rave (with bad results, because a drug trafficker feels that he hasbeen defrauded by her); then comes the story of a worker from the grocery store in English (same store) who goes to Vegas for the weekend with friends, where sex, rifle game and problemsstolen car come into play; then we see the story of two gay films actors (played by Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr) who deal with the strange insurance presentation of a cop and striking a girl (Sara)With their car; and, finally, we come to another worker of the grocery store (Katie Holmes) who has a strange fascination for said drug trafficker (the one mentioned earlier).
Really, everything is confusing to keep track of the review format, your best bet is to go well.
The film presents a very good game from all angles, and Limon adds the same humorous energy as what he had with swingers to this particular product.
The dialogue is quite catchy and the resolution is fairly well done, not to do for the happy ending and the bad ended end.
Consider it as an end, well.
The intertwining of stories is a particularly good element for the film, because it is never really confusing and tells different sides of the story, as the sliding doors have done a little.
However, it is better suited to the young generation that wants a little spices in their films, which the sliding doors do not have a little.
