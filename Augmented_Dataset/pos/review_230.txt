It is easy to label something sentimental or tear when we have not known sorrow of losing a child? That it can be in life or in death.
After saying that, I will also say that this film does all the above.
We get this feeling of suffocation in the throat (because of the sorrow) when a brother forgives an expensive error, or when a husband kisses his wife after a long distance.
There is no ocean, no drownings and he does not balance the memories of another? Ordinary people '.
In fact, the only thing from a distance connected to the ocean is probably the tap water and the rinsing of the toilets (not that it has literally happened in the film).
So what are the lessons learned: 1.
Do not bring your children to reunion in class.
2ne do not leave them quiet in the hall, not even for a second.
Michelle Pfeiffer once again plays the role of a very scrambled woman and mother, a trend with which he started? Thousand acres "and? One day '.
My comment is that it is exceptionally well tense in this film, so much so that when it has a nervous rupture, the veins of its temples swell impressively.
Whoopi Golberg also puts a discreet performance, playing a lesbian cop, with a name that makes you want to reach a lollipop.
Finally, who are the ideal companions for this kind of film? My grandmother comes to my mind.
