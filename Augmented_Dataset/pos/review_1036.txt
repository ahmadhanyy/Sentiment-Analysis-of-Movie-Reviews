The 30 -second Happy Bastard review
Notting Hill
A pretty romantic comedy by the writer of the successful comedy four marriages and a burial, Notting Hill features Julia Roberts like Anna Scott, a very popular actress with a demanded prize of $ 15 million for films.
One day, she walks in a travel bookstore belonging to a simple resident of London (played by Hugh Grant), and sparks are somehow flying.
Of course, there are agitation points, such as the slightly disgusting roommate support for Grant (but very hilarious), the ex-annoying friend of Anna (Alec Baldwin in a humorous cameo), and, in additionThis fucking press.
This is a new kind of complexity to see in a romantic comedy, very different, let's say, a stubborn father or "not the right time" as we see in the usual films.
Roberts is great as an actress surprisingly beautiful, and Grant is surprisingly good because the simple guy always trying to grasp what really happened with this girl.
In short, a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs, especially supplied by Spike.
