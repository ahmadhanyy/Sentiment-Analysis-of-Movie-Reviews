Is Jimmy Stewart the biggest actor of all time?
It's entirely possible.
His career has lasted over 40 years and played in more films than most actors could never.
However, when we speak in the media, he is generally considered as an actor who has played a type of role: the nice guy.
And it's really a shame.
 "The Naked Spur" presents Jimmy Stewart in a completely different role from what people would expect from him.
He is a western, in which Stewart specializes in this period, and he launched it like a desperate man to recover a bonus on a man who was his friend.
Before finding this man, however, he meets two men who agree to help him, thinking that he is a sheriff.
When the criminal is finally caught up, the two men discover Stewart's secret and decide that they also want a piece of action.
The rest of the film is a suspense trip in which each man constantly suspects the other.
The woman also traveling with the criminal, well played by Janet Leigh.
We are never too sure who she is really at the end.
Leigh is an actress probably better known for her role as "shower" of "psycho", and it is unfair.
She gives a strong performance as a woman who is drawn between these two men.
Stewart gives a performance that doesn't look like everything Iâ€™ve ever seen from him.
It generally remains in cool whatever happens, but here it sometimes becomes hysterical.
I think he may have taken this role to prove to the public that he was more than just "nice guy".
His performance sometimes borders psychotic, but I loved looking at it every second.
These are roles like this one that make me admire it as much as I do.
He was an actor without fear of taking risks and even ruining his public image.
