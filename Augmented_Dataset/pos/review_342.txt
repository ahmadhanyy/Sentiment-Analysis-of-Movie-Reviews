I don't know what film the criticisms saw, but it was not this one.
The popular consensus among newspapers was that this film is funny and terribly boring.
In my opinion, they could not have more trouble.
If you were waiting for the plane!
Laughter and Agatha Christie-Intense Mystery, so yes, this film would be a disappointment.
However, if you are just looking for a pleasant film and a good time, it's the one to see.
Honest, it's.
This story concerns a 4th network, WBN, which took American waves in 1939.
Penny Henderson (Mary Stuart Masterson), the secretary of the owner of the resort, has to face her authoritarian boss, a sponsor and unimpressed writers ready at any time, partly thanks to the fact that they were not paidsince weeks.
Among chaos, she also has to face her future ex-husband, Roger (Brian Benben) who desperately wants to come back.
Unfortunately, his problems only get worse over the night and the number of bodies increases without explanation.
While trying to court Penny, Roger has to face the police and try to find the killer hiding in WBN.
Mary Stuart Masterson does well in her role as Penny (I try to be impartial, so I will not tell you how incredible she looks), although Brian Benben has the most screen time.
With the two tracks, there are several recognizable faces, including Corbin Bernsen (L. A.
Law), Michael McKean (Laverne & Shirley) and Bobcat Goldthwait.
The special effects are incredible and adorned me (which some can support is not very difficult to do) in many scenes.
Although the film sometimes passes over board with physical comedy, it compensates more than these errors throughout the film.
Overall, I gave it, or one, depending on the system you use.
