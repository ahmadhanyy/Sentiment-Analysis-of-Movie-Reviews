Synopsis: In this film, Steven Spielberg, one of today's best directors, tries to spice up the history of the 1800s with a long audience battle on the fate of the Cinque prisoner (Djimon Hounsou) - -A young man angry with Sierra Leone who was removed Danseclavation - - and his prisoners' colleagues.
Cinque and his friends won a ship on the banks of America after having escaped the merchants of Spanish slaves, but as the Americans do not speak the tongue of Cinque, black men are transported in court to determine S 'They are legally or not slaves.
Technically, since the trafficking in international slaves was prohibited at that time, people like Cinque could not be kidnapped in slavery; a slave had to be born to be legally considered as a slave.
Lawyers Baldwin and Adams (Matthew McConaughey and Anthony Hopkins) must prove Cinque and the others have been captured in slavery, rather than slaves born, in order to bring them out of prison as free men.
Three long judicial cases are represented with Spielberg brand panache - - Flashy start, many facial close -ups, great music and dramatic images.
A final discourse of Adams is followed by an anticlimax where the subtitles show what ultimately happened to the different characters.
Opinion: making a fictitious film is easier than making one on real life.
In fiction, we invent the good and the bad guys and the bad guys and the bad guys, puts the fictitious characters in conflict and brings history to its exciting conclusion.
Real life, however, is made up of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand on, think of thoughts and do nothing, or come and come before the resolution of events.
Spielberg gives us a story of real visually spicy and historically precise life.
Djimon Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins transform excellent performance.
