Kundun de Martin Scorsese, who tells about the first twenty years of the life of the Dalai Lama currently exiled, was criticized for his lack of narrative structure.
Personally, I don't think he needs it: it works perfectly as a study of Tibetan Buddhist culture and how communist China.
Scorsese considers Dalai Lama as many Tibetans probably do so, as a greater symbol than life of Buddhist spirituality and political leadership: the only glimpses in his head come from several interesting but oblique dream sequences, but his representation agreesA film which focuses on politics and the spiritual rather than the staff.
The design and cinematography are exceptional, and although Scorsese sometimes seems to be swept away by the show, it helps to increase cultural contrast when the Dalai Lama goes to China to meet President Mao.
Political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start screaming slogans, Kundun does not do so: he succeeds in transmitting his message in an artistically interesting way and without being too manipulated.
