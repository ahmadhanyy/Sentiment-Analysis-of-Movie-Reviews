The threat of meteors is ready to impress all volcanoes and twisters!
Summer is still there!
This season could probably be the most ambitious = the season this decade with Hollywood films that have extinguished films like Deep Impact, = Godzilla, The X-Files, Armageddon, The Truman Show, which only has a main objective, to shake the box office.
The Million Directorate This summer is = Deep Impact, one of the first releases of films from the production company of DreamWorks for the production of Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen.
According to = the rather lamentable demonstration of their two previous versions; Mousehunt and = Amistad, Deep Impact shines with elements that could make one = of the greatest films of the year.
Deep Impact begins with the discovery of a comet linked to the land during an exit of school astronomy by Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood) which = then aroused the political community of the world.
Keep = information under the Wraps to avoid generalized panic, President Beck = (Morgan Freeman) took on him and his subordinates to execute a highly secret space project to destroy the comet before he strikes = earth.
While continuing a story of Sex-Scandal among the presidential, ambitious, journalist to come, Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) = deploys the wool that President Beck drew on the citizens of = world.
As if the knowledge of the imminent annihilation of humanity was = not enough, Jenny must accept his father (Maximillian = Schell) leaving the mother for a younger woman. = 20
President Beck announces the discovery and preparations to destroy the = comet exactly a year later, with so much confidence that he left the no = trace of panic within the American community.
Reaching the reputation of = announcement of the comet Wolf-Beiderman in-earth on earth (the name of = his discoverers), Leo Beiderman continues life in his small town as a young celebrity.
A team of astronauts, led by the aging veteran = the astronaut Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), was secretly formed to transport = the mission of landing on the comet and of creating and explosion with a nuclear apparatus, withThe hope of making him explode his current path = towards the earth.
Although it is the most experienced of the team, the = younger generation of astronauts in the team doubts the ability to tan due = at its age.
But these are only problems of individuals.
Life on Earth = continues like any other day, confident that the comet will be destroyed.
When the attempt to avoid Wolf-Beiderman's path failed and has divided Le = Comet in two: Comet Wolf and Comet Beiderman, the president = deploys his emergency plan to evacuate a part of the population, leaving = theremains to die.
Citizens are chosen at random to live underground for 2 years before the impact, when the dust due to the impact around the Earth settled, at that time, all life on the surface would be dead.
Jenny and Leo = were chosen but many of their relatives were not, only a handful of the population of the earth will be saved from destruction.
= 20
The moving moments of Deep Impact occur in the scenes of special effect laces =.
Although the effects are fantastic, they only form a small part of = the film, which engages in the development of its main characters =; leo, lerner and tanner.
Leo's struggle when he learns that = his girlfriend is not part of the population to save, Lerner's = decrease the relationship with his father and his pain for the mother = loneliness, Tanner strives to win the respect thatIt deserves its sound = the crew and its ultimateacrifice, all form the dorsal spine of the depth of Deep Impact = MOV.
The deep impact smells with suspicion as the previous year = release contact despite vivid differences.
I think it is probably because = they both plunge into a story of world proportions and engages in the premise of hope, faith and life itself.
The two do not strongly depend on = the protective protector in the form of CGI effects.
Mimi director Leder (who won = many reward television series and made his debut with = Peacekeer last year) is definitely a director to watch. = 20
Although it is the first of the two meteor films this summer (the = others being Armageddon), I think there will be striking differences in the approach = of the subject.
Although the premise of the two may be the same, the execution and the focus of the films will actually show that Deep = Impact has more concentration on the human elements than Armageddon, which is done = by the team that has usBring in bad boys, Crimson Tide and the rock.
= 20
A deep impact should be able to satisfy a variety of audiences; DU = the most action-active to those who simply want to immerse themselves in its premise of manipulation but nevertheless dramatic.
