Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:
peak hour
So what is the problem with 48 hours of clones these days?
They always try for the same thing as Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte.
It was the problem that tormented these clones, not to mention the real suite: 48 other hours, a complete waste of film.
But, finally, someone has a different vision of the question, and it is the director Brett Rainer.
Rush Hour presents Jackie Chan in his first U.S.Film of action, playing a Chinese detective which is transported to the United States to investigate the kidnapping of the daughter of the Chinese consulate.
Of course, the FBI is upset that it interferes in their investigation and sticks it with a LAPD office with a big mouth - of course, it is Chris Tucker.
What makes rush hours work so well is the chemistry between the energetic channel and the absolutely hilarious tucker.
Tucker comes to Chan on every occasion given ("I'm Michael Jackson, you Tito."), And Chan offers some zincs, as well as great combat scenes.
History is roughly your average price, but with a decent turn involving the main villain, a very troubled figure called Jun Tao.
At least it is entertaining, and the concept is perfectly achieved.
A particular combat scene in a Chinese office, where Chan and Tucker Duke It Out with the bad guys, are funny and energetic at the same time.
And the final is also a real treat ...
Offers yet another fantastic blow for fans with a drop of 10 floors.
The rush hour is just the kind of film that you will kick any night of the week.
Just make sure you don't look for anything culturally different and everything will be well-drunk II, this is not the case.
