Well, I know that Stallone is 50 years old now, but in daylight, he doesn't look at him!
Daylight is a great film in the event of a disaster.
If you've already seen Cliffhanger, you already know the character of Stallone.
A guy with a bad past, but is in the right place at the wrong time.
A tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey has collapse on both sides when a group of thieves collided with a truck bearing * very flammable toxic waste.
A dozen people survive the collapses and the incineratic fire ball (and what a ball of fire!)
Stallone, a former emergency medical service, heats a rich couple when they reach the outside of the tunnel, before the explosion.
Then, 30 minutes in the film, Boom!
> From now on, the plot takes a rear seat, and we are entitled to some of the best camera and action staged action.
Most of the actions are plausible and will hold you on the edge of your seat.
There are a few melodramatic pieces here, but they tend to work well.
There is no general antagonist in this film, but the action and the suspense make you forget.
Daylight is a great film, I saw a non-mattress show it, and I thought it was worth every penny.
The characterizations are mainly flat, a dimesion, but they have enough to make you take care of certain characters.
Rob Cohen (Dragonheart) does an excellent job with this film.
