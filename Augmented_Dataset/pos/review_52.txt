The comedy with a hilarious and ultra-faible budget of Kevin Smith is a day in the lives of two convenience store slackers (Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson).
They spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything, from Fellatio to self-filing.
The premise is strictly sitcom and photography is granular like all releases, but you could spend the film's budget ten times ($ 27,000) and always obtain a half as good as it.
Originally noted NC-17 for the language.
Not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears.
Kill Zoe ============
Remake of reservoir dogs as a French art film and you are halfway to kill Zoe, the slow story of Zoe / Director Roger Avary of a Bastille Bank Flight.
Eric Stoltz embodies an American in Paris who sets out * above his head when he connects with a band of nihilist bank thieves.
He is the safecracker who is happy not to know that banking work is a job of boot of the word Go.
Although integrating on all fronts, the film is punctuated by the speed of Pulp Fiction, which Avary co-written with Quentin Tarantino.
in English and French.
The road to Wellville ====================.
Based on the novel by T.Coraghessan Boyle, the road to Wellville is not far away.
The intestines, the intestines and more intestine are explored by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (an Anthony Hopkins with Buck Dents and Glasses), which, in the early 1900s, recommended abstinence, vegetarianismand frequent defecation.
He also invented the Cornflake.
Really .
Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda, are only two of the many well -known faces of this failed comedy.
Leave your laughs at the door and you can amaze the funny antics of John Cusack, Michael Lerner, Lara Flynn Boyle, John Neville and Dana Carvey.
The artistic direction is impeccable and some of the first sequences are fun, but the novelty dissipates quickly while the writer / director Alan Parkers tries his excavation of transforming DOOOO in drama.
What he ends up is something that I can't print here.
Phew!
Stargate =========
Lawrence of Arabia meeting Star Wars.
This epic science fiction film is a more transparent spectacle than anything else.
Director Roland Emmerich (Solider Universal) shamelessly tears Lucas and Spielberg and almost any other cosmic shot on which he can put his hands.
The film is too long, the characters are made of cardboard and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in the history of modern science fiction.
That said, there is still a lot to look at here.
Science fiction fans should take advantage of sculpted sands, Morphing headdresses and surprisingly courageous James Spaders.
He plays the Egyptologist who can prove his theory that "someone else" has built the pyramids.
The Kurt Russell co-stars and Jaye Davidson are less interesting from Crying Game Fame.
Star trek generations =======================
Trek fans are perhaps more indulgent, but, for the rest of us, the start trek generations are at best a mixed bag.
The story is interesting, but each scene goes for too long.
The cast is serious, but the management lacks punch.
And so on .
 (The best example of the latter is a co -apple of Klingon which offers no impact of a similar scene in Star Trek II.)
Captain of the original company James T.KIRK appears at the two ends of history, although they cut the scene where Shatner turns to the screen to plead "Get a Life".
Remarkably banal.
Miracle on 34th Street =======================
In a specialist and Pulp Fiction and Al season, perhaps a miracle remake on the 34th street * is * necessary.
John Hughes certainly believes in Santa Claus and his production led by the Mayfield does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original.
The romance between the Costars Dylan McDermott and Elizabeth Perkins do not work too well, but the film argues that Richard attent The district is the final Kriss Kringle.
His chemistry with children can moisten any eye.
No claus for the alarm.
Junior =======
Arnold Schwarzenegger pregnant?
Of course, Billy Crystal has already done it during a rabbit test, but Schwarz's sight with a bombed belly is a casting coup comparable to Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie.
What should be nothing more than a premise in a joke actually improves as you go.
Director Ivan Reitman (Dave, Twins) wisely keeps the stuffing at least, so that the first hour moves more slowly than you expect.
Do not expect too many Danny Devito yuks, but you cannot beat these first romantic scenes between Emma and Arnie.
How is * for a collision of actor styles?
