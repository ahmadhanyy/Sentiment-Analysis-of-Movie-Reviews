In one of my many videos that I have reached from the local library, Casablanca was my third classic in a few weeks.
The others being Citizen Kane and Vertigo (yes, I try to see so many greater films of AFI ever made as possible).
But, Casablanca stood out for me: it was actually observable.
What salutes the most like the greatest American film of all time, Casablanca is not so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle.
It seems that the star Humphry Bogart spends about 85% of the film with various leaders of the nation instead of ingesting Bergman.
It annoyed me, just like the end.
Why did the plan not turn around?!?
Surprisingly, I enjoyed the film.
I liked the character of Bogart and his game (not exaggerated like most of the actors of his time).
I read once if you had the choice to be in a film, which would be, and a woman said Casablanca.
At first, I said to myself "why?"
Then, watching the film again, I understood why.
The film is very well done and the first -rate script, although I doubt that I understood more than half of the political political jumbo.
Casablanca is, in my mind, not classic (like Solaris), but it's a good film and elegantly.
Hey, Hollywood, what about this: a remake with Harrison Ford and Anne HÃ©che?
Now it would be a classic.
