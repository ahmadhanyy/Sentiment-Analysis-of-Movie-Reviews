I saw several (but not as much) films Woody Allen.
I do not particularly have the days of radio, the purple rose of Cairo, play it again, Sam.
I really enjoyed the mystery of Manhatten's murder and everything ...
Sex, and I loved could be aphrodite.
However, I found that the Broadway balls were a sleepy bore.
And the bullets obtained very delusional criticism, but I didn't think I would like.
But I finally saw it (double function with ready to wear, I think) and I hated it.
Since ...
I love you also seems to have delusional criticism that I did not know if I would like to see ...
Fortunately, I did it!
People broke out in singing and dance, something that I almost never like.
But this film is so contagious.
and funny !
And entertaining!
 (And unlike Evita, they only sing when they need it.)
Of course, some actors may not be great singers, but they seem to have a good time, just like the public.
That's all I have to say.
Really, if you think it's going to be a boring movie, you're probably dead.
And the dead should not be forced into the cinemas.
Is Mark Leeper dead?
He said that "it's an almost horrible failure".
The film is classified r, for * a * use of the word mother * * * * *.
