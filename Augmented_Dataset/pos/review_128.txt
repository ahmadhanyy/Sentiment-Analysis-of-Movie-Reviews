Susan Granger review on "The Closet" (Miramax Films)
In this hilarious French farce, a shy and boring accountant (Daniel Auteil) appointed Fran√ßois Pignon discovers that he will be dismissed from his work in a condom factory.
Lonely and distraught, he plans to suicide.
But then, he ran into Belona (Michel Aumont), an elderly homosexual neighbor, who suggests a "sex discrimination" trial to intimidate management.
As proof, Belonecoche of provocative photographs of gable locked in a leather embrace with another man and sends them anonymously to the Pignon boss.
When racked snapshots begin to circulate around the factory, but not only gable finds its work, but the center of attention is suddenly found as an openly gay man.
Her vigorous supervisor (Michele Laroque) is so intrigued that she wonders if, perhaps, she could change her sexual preferences.
Even her ex-wife (Alexandra Vannoot) and her indifferent adolescent son (Stanislas Crevillen) drop their disdain.
But not everyone is delighted.
A colleague Mucho Macho, Felix (Gerard Depardieu), a self-justified homophobic, is amazed and pushed back when he is forced by the Director of Public Relations (Thierry Lhermite) to have fun and the pig court or risk losing hisown job.
The writer / director Francis Verber cleverly launches the wacky comedy while he dissects the hypocrisy of politically correct, moving off the track only occasionally in pedophilia.
Daniel Auteuil ("The widow of Saint -Pierre") is delicious - in particular with an inflated condom perched on his head, rolling on a tank in a parade of gay pride - and Gerard Depardieu offers one of his smallest andeffective, performance.
On Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "The Closet" is a frankly sexual adult 8.
He is so intelligent, in fact, that Hollywood already plans to do it again in English, like "La Cage aux Folles".
