The start of this film reminded me of the games of the Stargate film.
People are looking around in an Egyptian temple that will read a dangerous thing that will destroy the land in the future.
After a sort of confusing song involving false things from Cyborg, the film jumps in the future and the film improves a giant.
The basic idea behind the film is that from time to time (make around 1000 years) an evil force destroyed the earth.
The things necessary to defend oneself against this threat are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element.
The intrigue in this film is really not so important for the thing.
This film has very good special effects, most of them.
Techno-ish music in the background corresponds very well to the atmosphere.
Bruce Willis is an illegal taxi cabin driver in a futuristic city in New York.
One day, a lady draped with a few bandages falls into her trunk.
This film talks about what's going on.
The twists and turns are interesting and the film never fails to present to the spectator a variety of different places.
There are also a lot of action in the film, especially towards the end.
Some characters are simply strange, including a highly in draft energy.
Bruce Willis does her normal job to breathe things as he always does.
The film is definitely looking at and rarely slows down.
This is one of these science fiction films where you are going to say "cool" followed by a "What The Hell?!?!".
I give the fifth element.
