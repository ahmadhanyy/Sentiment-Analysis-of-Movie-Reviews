"You Got Mail" is the very definition of a "cute" film.
There are cute stars, a cute story and even cute pets.
Despite this excessive kindness (or perhaps because of that), I loved "You Got Mail".
I know I know .
I am supposed to be a film critic.
I am not supposed to love transparent images and formulas like this.
But damn, somewhere along the way, "you have mail" wrapped me, hook, line and pinker.
The film features Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as two somewhat unhappy New Yorkers who meet in an AOL online cat room and quickly become close friends, without ever knowing the identity.
As the film progresses, they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each other.
Meanwhile, in "real life", they are bitter competitors.
She has a picturesque bookstore for children, he has one of these gigantic super-books which offer impersonal prices and reduced prices.
While his store threatens to manage his bankrupt store, their online relationship is strengthened.
 "You Got Mail" is as artificial as films.
Everything is pleasant and happy and in the end, all the characters got exactly what they wanted out of life.
There are no real conflicts, no major disappointments, no unresolved problems.
Nevertheless, I appreciated it.
In fact, I don't remember the last time I had such a good time in the cinema.
I think you have to be able to watch a movie and register.
The fact that stars Hank and Ryan are at the top of their game does not hurt either.
In particular, Hanks is at his best here, turning his "M-Moir" until 11.
Whenever he was on the screen, he had all my attention.
And despite the fact that he led small bankruptcy bookstores, I supported him.
It was good to see Hanks in return do the best: play the affable affable.
 "You have mail" will certainly not win any price, but as a pure entertainment exercise, it is as good as possible.
