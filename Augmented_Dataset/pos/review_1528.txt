Your friends and neighbors are a rather weird film on 6 people, who go up and leave others.
Written and directed by Neil Labute, which is the first film, "In the Company of Men" was simply wonderful, disappointed a little with this one.
The story implies two couples (Ben Stiller and Catherine Keener and Aaron Eckhart & Amy Brenneman), an artist assistant (Nastassja Kinski), and a selfish abuser (Jason Patric).
The character's names are not apparent and are not mentioned throughout the film.
Each of the characters has their own sexual style and they do not seem well "merge".
Thus, the group is experimenting behind their respective partners.
There are hysterical scenes, one involves Jason Patric, Aaron Eckhart and the characters of Ben Stiller.
They are all in a sauna, speaking of their best "lay", when the character of Jason Patric makes a surprising confession.
The whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and played.
The film appreciated this film, although it seemed a bit long (even if it only works 99 min.).
The casting of the film is exceptional with the performance of Oscar caliber by Catherine Keener, Aaron Eckhart and Jason Patric.
I would not recommend this film, to people offended by very sexually explicit conversations.
It seemed to offend people, more than half of the theater people left during the film.
Although your friends and neighbors do not have the power of Labute's previous film, he always manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny, while maintaining a melancholy philosophy on human relations.
