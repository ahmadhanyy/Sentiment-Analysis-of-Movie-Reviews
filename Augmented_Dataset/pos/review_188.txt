"Footloose" has only one objective in mind: devine in an audience with a feeling of cheese and buffoonery of well-being.
And I hate admitting it; I fell in love with that.
The film talks about a teenager (bacon) who moves to a small town in the big city, and discovers that dance has been prohibited by the Reverend Local (Lithgow).
He ends up falling in love with the preacher's (singer) girl and showing to the whole city what the magic of dance can do.
As mentioned at the start of this review, "Footloose" is a drama for extremely hokey and predictable adolescents.
There is practically no surprise and the writing is second -order.
So why did I appreciate it so much?
On the one hand, the cast is great.
Kevin Bacon ooys charisma in an early role.
We care about it from the start and, unlike most films of this kind, Bacon does not play it as the "rebel without index" genre.
Yes, he rebellious, but he is also polite when he needs to be.
And it never covers.
The rest of the distribution is just as impressive.
John Lithgow, seen here playing a normal guy for a change, plays a man who would normally be a badly flat.
But Lithgow plays him as a worried father who tries to do what he thinks is best for his daughter.
At the end of the film, we feel a true sense of love and understanding between him and the character of Lori's singer.
Another beautiful touch is music.
We see the parents of children complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "sexual innuendos", but it is not at all true.
The title song, interpreted by Kenny Loggins, is optimistic and fun.
During the final sequence, I was overwhelmed by the desire to get off the sofa and start dancing.
Of course, I quickly realized that it would be a bit pathetic.
Anyway, "Footloose" is a charming little surprise.
Do not let the premise prevent you from looking at it.
It sucks me and it will do you the same.
