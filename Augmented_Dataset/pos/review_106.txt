Synopsis: Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is a former insurance investigator on the man's track who killed his wife.
Leonard has only a few clues about the identity of the murderer; to worsen things, he suffers from a condition that inhibits the creation of short -term memories, which means that Leonard always forgets what happened for a few minutesearlier.
For this reason, Leonard is forced to count on notes he leaves for himself.
 "Memento" retraces the investigation in the time of his apparent culminating point.
Critality: "Memento" is the kind of film I would have liked to write; I cannot think of any higher praise than that.
I avoid that Nolan has concocted an original film as brilliant and involved as this one.
An instant film classic, "Memento" is practically impeccable.
The script is different from all those I have ever seen - a notable realization in these days of recycled Hollywood homogeneity.
Although the idea of starting with the "conclusion" of the plot, then going back in time towards the "start -up" is not entirely new, I have never witnessed the execution with asuch as flair and such consistency.
 "Memento" is infinitely exciting and inventive, a rare story that makes viewers guess during the film itself, and reflecting on its connotations long after leaving the theater.
And it is not just a brain exercise; there is a lot of action and a dose of unexpected humor to keep the procedure alive.
Nolanâ€™s management is just as effective, without ever losing its sharpness and clarity despite the difficult gadget of "Memento".
And to top it off, all performances go up occasionally.
Pierce is great as Leonard in difficulty; Moss shows a wide range as an enigmatic natalie; and in Pantoliano plush reaches a beautifully affable but sinister quality.
 "Memento" is perhaps the best scenario of the year, and is certainly among the main theatrical attractions of 2001.
