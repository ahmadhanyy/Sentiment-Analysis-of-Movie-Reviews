Synopsis: Shrek (Myers) is an ogre living in satisfied solitude at the heart of a forest, until his house is invaded by fairy tales creatures fleeing the rule of the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow).
Farquaad agrees to move pests, provided that Shrek saves Princess Fiona (Diaz) - that Farquaad wishes to marinate - from a distant castle.
Reluctantly, Shrek leaves, joined in his quest by an unwanted companion, Donkey (Murphy).
Review: a memorable aspect of "Aladdin" from Disney was that he finally gave Robin Williams a character - the genius - to make the most of his comic talents.
 "Shrek" does the same for Eddie Murphy; ironically, however, Murphy's ideal ship turns out to be an ass.
All the same, "Shrek" has been the best comic strip out of Murphy for years, and as a name, it flies all the best lines.
For example, after being surrounded by elf dust while trying to hide his nature as a magical creature, Donkey flies in the air and laughs: "Now, I'm a donkey who speaks flying!"
And despite its many contributors, the script of "Shrek" is full of comic jewels.
Myers is delicious in the role of a hetero man, and Lithgow also gets great moments (watch a hilarious district with the gingerbread man).
 "Shrek" takes great pleasure in Lampoon of fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all kinds, and reserves a few delicious blows to Disney in the market.
Things get lost a little during the intermediate segment of the film, which focuses too much on the main characters at the expense of one of the formidable fairy tale satire which is the greatest strength of the film.
But even then, we can always sit down and enjoy the beautiful computer animation, whose remarkable use here represents another dazzling leap for technology.
