There was a huge crowd - so much by more than 100 people could not be admitted - during a first projection of "The Nephew" (first projection with general admission of the public).
It was a first of film at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.
Pierce Brosnan (007), produced his first film with Beau St.Clair.
It was a film constantly in motion and staff with beautiful scenes from Ireland.
Chad (Hill Harper, beloved) is a pretty nephew of the 17-year-old mixed race (African-American and Irish), the Irish mother who died.
He returns "in Ireland", living with the uncle of Curmudgeon, Tony Egan (Donal McCann).
He meets the character of Pierce Brosnan, Mr.o'Brady (or just Brady), because he falls in love with the beautiful girl.
There are many scenes (ah, character scenes) to laugh, others make tears.
The three mentioned above were first in the flesh, with director Eugene Brady.
After the film, they took questions.
The film was very good, it's not fantastic.
The nephew was not "picked up" in North America but was in the rest of the world.
The nephew is the secret of generation of a "titanic" proportion.
Hopefully the rest of America can see the nephew.
