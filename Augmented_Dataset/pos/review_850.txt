I can summarize the first strike in a word: great.
Never in my life, I have seen an actor as incredibly devoted as Jackie Chan.
For the simple reason that he made his own waterfalls in each of his films in which he appeared, he should be considerably rewarded.
The same Tom and Jerry formula which was used to make chan rumble in the Bronx and Supercop, therefore entertaining, can also be found here.
However, First Strike was probably the most exciting of the three, because the simple reason that the practice makes perfect.
His last two films were almost like a practice and it was great.
Like Rumble, this film talks about the mafia, the old KGB.
Now Chan must fight in the icy arctic temperatures of Ukraine against a group of very bad men.
The film's trailer sums up quite well.
The first strike is full of action, but the combat scenes are so fast and furious, they have almost a spiritual and Italian humor.
Jackie Chan is a regular actor.
Well, it's not Eddie Murphy, but he can really make you crack.
For example, he hangs a roof and he humorously taunts his enemies to pick him up, because he claims to be the Korean 007 (he is the secret agent James Bond).
Even the intrigue of this film has improved above the others, because a kind of twisted nuclear weapons agreement is sloppy and Jackie takes the blame.
But do not fear, because the Chinese mafia helps him discover the truth behind the incident.
With some of the high -flight waterfalls and the comedy that moves side, First Strike is a safe blow that is guaranteed to draw major and global attention.
