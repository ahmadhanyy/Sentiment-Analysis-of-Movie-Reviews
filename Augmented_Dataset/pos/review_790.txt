Defending your life is an imaginative vision of the beyond the twisted spirit of the writer-director Albert Brooks, who also plays in comedy.
After having died in a car accident, the day of his everyday anniversary, Brooks wakes up in Judgment City, a satirical interpretation of Purgatory where superior beings assess the lives of newly deceased earthlings.
Brooks has five days to convince two judges that he is worthy of transmitting to the upper plains of existence.
Enter Rip Torn as a smooth lawyer who defends Brooks before the court against prosecutor Lee Grant.
During his "essay", Brooks must see episodes of his life on a cinema screen, and these scenes are both hysterically funny and painfully poignant.
It is impossible to withstand Brooks's clove (and hits) while he and Torn try to explain his loose behavior on earth.
Torn, in particular, is in vintage comic form, and it moves away with the image.
The film also presents Meryl Streep, attractive as an interest in love, and Shirley Maclaine, which appears in a hilarious cameo.
Although the film is uneven, many of its gags are less price.
Take, for example, City judgment food: it is always the most delicious that you have ever tasted ...
And it's also without calories - so chow!
