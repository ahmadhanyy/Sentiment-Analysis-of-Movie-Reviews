`` Strange Days' tells the last two days of 1999 in Los Angeles.
While the inhabitants are preparing for the new millennium, Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) goes to his occupations to peddle clips of erotic memory.
He pines for his ex-girlfriend, Faith (Juliette Lewis), not noticing that another friend, Mace (Angela Bassett) really cares about him.
This film presents good performances, an impressive technique for making films and breathtaking crowd.
Director Kathryn Bigelow knows her things and does not hesitate to use it.
But as a whole, it is an unsatisfactory film.
The problem is that the writers, James Cameron and Jay Cocks, were too ambitious, targeting a film with social relevance, thrills and a drama.
It is not that the production of ambitious film should be discouraged; just that when it does not manage to achieve its objectives, it fails badly and obviously.
The film ends up just preaching, without solution and little involved.
