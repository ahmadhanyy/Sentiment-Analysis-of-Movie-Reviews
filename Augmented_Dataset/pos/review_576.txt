I'm beginning to be fed up with it.
During my four years as a critic, the thing that made me advance is the moderate balance of films.
The good balance the bad.
I try to see the two in equal proportions.
But the remake Mighty Joe Young from Disney marks the fourth week during which I did not see a really terrible film.
It is a machismo behind, I suppose, the desire to see the things you hate if; but I need to see a bad movie from time to time.
And, you know what, Mighty Joe Young does not qualify.
Far from being bad, Mighty Joe Young is actually a fun film with the family.
It's pleasant, appropriate, cute, cuddly, and all these other things I saw in each film since the life of a bug.
Mighty Joe Young follows a 2,000 -pound gorilla in the wilderness of Africa which is taken to a reserve ...
California?
 ...
To keep safe.
All right .
A little unrealistic, but which has already said a children's film must have had the slightest suspicion of realism.
The first half of the film is a gorilla in hatred to the mist of the feminine motif of poachers.
The second half is a direct parody of King Kong, amazed spectators and everything.
Mark downwards.
I feel relaxed.
It is, in fact, an extremely non -creative film.
But, as a vetter, I can say very honestly that creativity does not count as much as it should.
So it saves Mighty Joe from my anger, although my colleagues and cohorts and surely denigrate this film right now.
It is not the film to make a girl at an appointment.
This is not the film for you.
This is the film for you and your family.
When you are next to your child, all normal rights and tortifications escape.
The same thing happens when you watch a horror film or a action film.
It becomes fun.
Everything you have to do to take advantage of Mighty Joe Young is closure and surveillance.
