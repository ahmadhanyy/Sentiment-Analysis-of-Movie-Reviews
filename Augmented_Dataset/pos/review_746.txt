Okay, let me say, it's a Beavis and Butthead film.
If you don't like Beavis and Butthead, don't see this film !!!!!
However, if you like them, I recommend that you go out now and go see it.
The film begins with the boys wondering what happened on their television.
They notice that it was stolen and they swear to find it.
This wind through America in search of Dallas (it's a woman).
They are looking for it because as they are looking for television, they find a drunk who wants them to "make" his wife.
Well, of course, they think they want them to mark with her when he actually wants to kill her.
And pleasure begins their.
This film is a mixture of funny gags that Anly Beavis and Butthead could withdraw.
It is a quality entertainment that the only fan of Beavis and Butthead would appreciate.
I really enjoyed this film because Mike Judge knew how to follow the rhythm.
Even when they crawled into the desert and I thought the film had started to hang out, it manages to keep the laughs to come.
If you are waiting for changes to the show, keep looking.
The same character, the same voices, the same all in the series and that is what makes him good.
You might think that with a movie from a TV show, you can change a few things.
Often this expresses the disaster for films because the filmmakers move away from what made the spectacle popular in the first place!
