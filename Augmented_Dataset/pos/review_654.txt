Most films seem to be released a third film just so that he can be called a trilogy.
Rocky III seems to adapt in this category, but manages to be slightly unique.
The rocky formula of "Rocky loses Fight / Rocky Trains / Rocky Wins Fight" is made to the letter.
In addition, the "tradition" to show the last five minutes of the rocky past is also used.
This film begins with a series of clips showing how Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) has become famous ...
Even showing a brief appearance on Sesame Street !!
Then he advances with Rocky being in a fixed fight with Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan).
A mysterious villain known as Clubber Lang (Mr. T) Trash has repercussions in Rocky about his stupid decision to withdraw from boxing and that he "displays the madman" so as not to be out and fight outright.
The Rocky coach (Burgess Meredith) tells Rocky not to fight, but the Italian stallion does not listen.
Naturally, he gets his ass kicked.
Somewhere along the line after several things happen.
Rocky's longtime coach dies, making Rocky train with his former opponent Apollo Creed.
The Rocky wife complains to her husband that he should fight.
The final fight follows between Clubber and Rocky.
Guess who wins?
The name of the winner rhymes with "Smocky".
The film is mainly ending due to the performance of Clubber Lang.
The dramatic aspect has been considerably attenuated from Rocky II and now the action seems to be the strong point of the film.
Which is good if you like to fight scenes.
The last match is actually quite decent.
If you liked the previous films, rent it.
It is worth seeing if you are a fan of the series.
But if you can't stand Rocky shouting "Adrianne !!"
Once again, see something else.
