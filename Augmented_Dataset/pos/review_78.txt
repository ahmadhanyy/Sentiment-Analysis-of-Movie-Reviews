Sometimes a film arrives a little bit of the rest.
Some people call it "original" or "artistic" or "abstract".
Some people simply call it "bin".
A less ordinary life certainly causes mixed feelings.
Certainly a generation-X film aimed at, a less ordinary life has everything, from clay to profane angels to a musical dream sequence based on karaoke.
Phew!
Anyone in their thirties or above will probably not understand what can be appreciated in this film.
It's a bit silly, it's somewhat scandalous, and it's certainly not your typical romantic story, but for the right audience, it works.
Lots of media threshing surrounds this film because of the fact that it comes from the same team that brought us trains.
Well, the sorry people, but I haven't seen trainspotting, so I can't really compare myself.
Whether or not it works in favor of this film exceeds me or not.
But I know this: Ewan McGregor, which I had never had the pleasure of looking at, definitely charmed me.
He was great!
The character of Cameron Diaz was uneven and a little difficult to grasp.
The public may find it difficult to worry about her, thus discouraging hopes of seeing her unite with McGregor after we are immediately sucked in taking care and identifying with him.
wrong?
you bet .
adorable?
you bet .
A less ordinary life was a delight and even had a bonus for me when I realized that it had been filmed in my hometown of Salt Lake City, Utah.
It was just one thing more than I didn't know about this film when I sat with an order of five dollars of Nachos and a three -dollars coke.
Perhaps not to know that the premise behind this film made a pleasant surprise, but I think that even if I knew, I would have been just as happy.
A less ordinary life is eccentric, eccentric and downright charming!
Not for everyone, but a definitive change in pace for your typical night in the cinema.
