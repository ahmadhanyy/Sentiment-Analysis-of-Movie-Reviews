Let's face it: Since Waterworld has floated, the summer films season developed * very *.
Without a new fight against the eyes for four weeks in a row, we had to support ourselves on the almost nutritional value of cheater spares, itinerant chocolate sellers and serial killers generated by computer.
sigh .
Thank goodness for Desperado.
The freewheeling rest of the first start of $ 7,000 from El Mariachiachi - director Robert Rodriguez - triggers a cool Antonio Banderas as a name -up guitarist.
He is a man in black with a revenge on his mind and an arsenal in his case.
 (The woman he loved was killed in the first film.)
Thus, he spends the whole story shooting on drug traffickers; a kind of Tex-Mex version of Punisher, if you want.
There is not much emotional nucleus for Desperado.
Rodriguez has too much fun finding new innovative ways to pay tribute to John Woo.
 (and Sergio Leone ...
And Sam Peckinpah ...)
Some can cling to the number of bodies - at least 100 graphic murders is a fair estimate - but everything is played for laughter.
Big, wide and Hispanic laughs who, for me, remembers the physical comedy of Blake Edwards and his Pink Panther films.
MÃ©diques, funny fun.
