Cinematically speaking, the original of Gordon Parks 1971 _shaft_ is not a big film.
A little slow sometimes and more than a little rough on the edges while he accumulates his culminating explosion with a violent action, this animated but formula which initially brought the "black private dick of Ernest Tidyman whois a sex machine for all "people" chicks The big screen is barely considered a revolutionary cinema.
However, almost 30 years after his original release - and long after the genre, he generated, "Blaxploitation", died with this decade - the _shaft_ of 1971 remains an extremely entertaining watch, never having completely escaped consciencepop culture.
The reason is the same which explains the connection of the film with moviegoers far beyond the target African-American public: the title character of John Shaft.
Although the fact that the strong, intelligent, virile and superbly suave well is black is the main factor in its historical and cultural meaning, its wide appeal follows from an idea that transcends the race: it is comfortable, confident and proud of whichIs and whoever had a problem with that could simply kiss her ass.
This fact also explains why John Shaft's John Singleton's renewal of John Singleton is as pleasant as it is.
Like the film that started the franchise, the intrigue of this _shaft_ does not mark points in the department of originality, but the energy level and the fluid attitude distinguishes it from standard criminal thrillers.
Contrary to what has been reported in recent months, this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film, but more a suite / fallout.
The star public knew and likes the original film and its first two suites (1972 _shaft's_big_score! _ And _shaft_in_africa_ from 1973), Richard Roundtree, once again plays John Shaft, who always manages a private investigation company in New York.
However, the film focuses on its homosexual nephew (Samuel L. Jackson), which, while the film begins, is a cop whose behavior to take away does not constantly disagree with its superiors.
When a privileged young man named Walter Wade Jr. (Christian Bale) accused of a brutal and racial motivated murder is authorized to be released on bond, a disgusted tree leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own.I .
But it is easier to say than to do, because also on the way of the stem and its way of justice is the peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), a Dominican gangster which is hired by Walter to erase the Diane Palmieri waitress(Toni Collette), the only eye for his crime.
The peoples - or, rather, Wright is also the big obstacle of the Jackson way to the commander of this film.
People is more a scandalous comic strip character for most of the operating time, and Wright is incredibly funny during these steps.
However, it is not so funny for the character presents himself as clumsy and buffoon, and the possible turn of people towards a more serious wickedness is seamless and credible (which would probably not have been the case if hehad been played by the choice of Originaljohn Leguizamo casting, which lost before the shooting).
It is not easy to steal a film at the Jackson (which is his usual captivating charismatic self here), but that's exactly what Wright does - and makes him look effortlessly.
Again, with such a talented set that surrounds him, it is not too surprising that the impressive Jackson star tower does not completely survive the rest; it is strongly completed not only by Wright, but onall his other co-stars.
Bale has already proven his ability to play a Uppity killer in _American_PSYCHO_, so he follows that his performance as a similar and less exaggerated character would be perfect.
Collette lends to film a convincing and welcome dramatic weight as a frightened and conflictual Diane.
Busta Rhymes makes you laugh while Shaft Rasaan's companion.
Register not as strongly - but without lack of Their - Vanessa Williams (as a tough cop of narcotics Carmen Vasquez) and a roundtree dismayed by narcotics; they are simply given to them in the script credited with Richard Price, Singleton and Shane Sallerno.
 (Jackson also has little to "do" in one direction; some disposable images during the opening credits apart, his tree does not even have a sex scene.)
This singleton proves again that its capacity with the actors is a particularly good thing because it is not really an action director.
This does not mean that he is doing a bad job with the many shootings and the proceedings by car required.
They move well (just like the film as a whole) and are reasonably exciting; it's just that there is nothing terribly inventive about them.
These sets are functional in the way the script is: they work well enough, but they are not surprising and conventional.
But if there is something that a film _shaft_ does well, it makes the familiar cool - and this _shaft_ maintains this tradition in life.

Even a common visual tip like using fanciful wipes for stage transitions does not only feel uncompromising, it seems necessary.
Style is not exactly an excellent film, but as far as _shaft_ is concerned, this is of little consequence.
What matters above all is to have a good time, and the last _shaft_ should be just the first of the many fun rides to do with this bad Mutha - make a mouth.
