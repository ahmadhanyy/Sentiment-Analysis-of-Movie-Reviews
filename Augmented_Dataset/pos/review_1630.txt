When I was asked to see this film with a friend, my first reaction was? Not Hugh Grant! '
I was perhaps wrong to be so hard, but after his insidious flirt with a street whore, I just couldn't imagine it in a romantic advance.
What makes this film a wonderful experience is not the fact that it features Hugh, but because it features Julia and wears a brilliantly written script.
This writer Richard Curtis, whose first exceptional work? Four marriages and funeral show us that he is a master in the field of romantic comedy, with drama splashes launched between the two.
Hugh and his hair are almost identical to the character who made him famous? Four marriages ‚Äù.
He plays an ordinary guy who is below and his luck.
Unfortunately, he is playing in this role, but fortunately, it works well for him in this film.
If only he was a little less.
Julia knows this role well.
The glamorous movie star looking for true love.
There are moments in this film, which you almost cry for its pain felt by loneliness.
As it must be sad to be so rich and beautiful, but for anyone with whom to share it.
The writer deals with difficult questions of love and social class at different levels.
How the differences in social position can make almost impossible for the love of growing up in such a hard environment.
How the media can be as cruel as possible and how the achievement of life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice.
