It is the best British gangster film since the long Friday, Good Friday.
Jon Bennet (played by Andrew Howard) is a very good assassin.
As such, he is probably a bad man, but that does not concern him.
It has become an undeniable weapon.
He is using an ankle worker (David Calder) much worse than him.
But even the assassins have innocent past.
He meets an old man from school and he is married to a school girlfriend from school.
Complete things is that they live near the place where he had a recent job and their young girl may have seen him in crime.
A big piece of what makes this film work is the representation of the working ankle.
Calder is a familiar player in Great Britain, but not frequently seen in the United States.
It has been seen in the world is not enough.
Here he creates one of the best villains on the screen in recent years.
It is both attractive and repellanting like a beautiful poisonous snake.
His lair is underground, apparently in a sewer, where he lives as the king of sewer rats.
It is the pivot that pulls the strings that will control the life of Bennet.
Paul Sosssy who heads the majority of his career as director of photography and like the lain of the ice ax, he molded class and style images in the dark.
Using the semi-drark and leaving the colors of deep blue and black dominate each scene, it makes the film visually as disturbing as anything in this lower world.
It is a cold and hostile world.
Sorossy creates much more a world of violence by what we mean that we see.
This is a film with great physical violence that occurs just out of reach.
We see very little but we hear much more and we imagine more than that.
The scenario is by Peter Waddington based on the novel by Neil Cross, but it's the film by Sossysy.
He creates indelible images of evil.
I note an 8 on scale 0 to 10 and a low +3 on the scale from -4 to +4.
 (I hope they do not use the slogan "Don't joke with Mr. in-Between.")
