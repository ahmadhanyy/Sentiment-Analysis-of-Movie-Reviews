Warning: Anyone who has offended by a blatant and loyal machismo would better avoid this film.
Or a lot of blood and guts, men against men and Mano-Et-Mano stuff.
In other words, it's a Walter Hill film!
With a John Milius script!
I still imagine these guys gathering and producing a film between the matches against my arms.
These films always contain male characters with whom I have a hard time identifying myself, probably because of the probability that any meeting between them and me would cause my arm torn off, then my later death by beating with said member.
And we had tough people in Gogo, here; drug banditos by dozens, all dirty and sweaty and quite unhappy, overall; a secret working group of the army commandos which are in the region to beDisper (supposedly) any link between the government and the drug runners; and many of Texas dirt farmers with shit who pulled you so early between your eyes looking at you.
In particular, we obtained Nick Nolte as Ranger du Texas Hard, Powers Boothe as a drug chevron, Michael Ironsides as head of the secret army, and torn RIP as a local sheriff.
Torn is the sympathetic figure of the group; he smiles before anyone.
As for women ...
Well, I have never seen Jane Fonda or Meryl Streep in a Walter Hill film, and at this rate, I doubt that I will never do it.
Women exist here to appear well, comfort the man and argue.
God!
Just like the old days ...
Frankly, it's a very good film, if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff.
The cinematography is excellent, the distribution of characters is wide and has a texture, the script is quite good and the film allows you to follow what is happening yourself, without spelling yourself.
I appreciate a film that makes me think of following.
Finally, there are a lot of shootings in slow motion Sam Peckinpah.
