This British import follows the (evil) adventures of a group of young people who are crazy about heroin.
There is Marc Renton (who tells), Spud (the Dim-wimp) Boy Malad (the obsessive Sean Connery), and Begbee (obsessive violence).
Propelled by a higher price, but not the soundtrack of the upper name (Iggy Pop, Sleeper, Elastica, Lou Reed ...) The film follows back, returns in the heroine and becomes clean again.
Part of the spirit of this film is clear and fiction in paste, and a game is simply stupid and more stupid (the sheets) and stupid (the bb pistol) although the film begins on a comic note, itIt takes a sharp term, and becomes almost depressing.
The film is based on a Welsh novel by Irving bearing the same title.
I can honestly say that this is one of the best films I have ever seen.
It is a dark jewel that was on the shadow in the United States by films such as Mission Impossible and ID4.
The film is difficult to follow with the heavy accents of the actors.
It is a very original film, with regard to films today.
It definitively deserves several views (partly because of the slang and the accents) Jeremy Dennison MR.Orange @ centuryter.filet
