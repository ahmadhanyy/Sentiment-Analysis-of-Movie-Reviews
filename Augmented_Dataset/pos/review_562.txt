This three -hour film opens with a view of the singer / guitarist / musician / composer Frank Zappa repeating with his colleagues member of the group.
Everything else displays a compilation of sequences, mainly from the Palladium concert in New York, Halloween 1979.
Other images show madness behind the scenes and the incredible clay animation of Bruce Bickford.
The performance of "Titties and Beer" played in this film is very entertaining, with the drummer Terry Bozzio providing the devil's voice.
Frank's guitar solos surpass all Van Halen or Hendrix that I have ever heard.
The bizarre clay animation of Bruce Bickford is that of belief with zooms, morphings, etc. and in fact, it doesn't even look like clay, it looks like meat.
