Quaid plays a man who took over the Dragonslayer profession after feeling that he is betrayed by a dragon at the start of the film.
He meets the last dragon that exists, and there is a really fun battle between the two which results in a confrontation where Quaid is in the mouths of the dragons, but his sword pointed out the brain of the dragons.
Finally, they decide to call a truce and they conclude an agreement.
Since he is the last dragon, he will pretend to die and Quaid can be paid for this.
Their scam works at the beginning, until they come to a city without money.
Instead, the city sacrifices a girl with the dragon, but of course, Draco is a pretty droagon, so he will not eat it. There is however a very funny scene where Draco strikes the girl.
Of course, as you can probably see by the plot, it's an silly film, but he knows when to take himself seriously at the right time, unlike Eddie, who was serious all the time.
You could probably call it a medieval comedy, because there are more laughs here than Eddie and Spy Hard combined.
Dennis Quaid makes a good hero.
Pete Posthlewaite provides a ghreat comedy as a monk who travels with them.
Dina Meyer is attractive as a sacrificed girl.
But let's face it, the film really concerns the dragon and what an incredible creation it is.
Connery's voice and ILM combine to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon.
So, if you will see this film for a strong medieval epic with a hard core, you go to the bad film.
If you are leaving for the dragon, you will not be disappointed and you will be provided with a lot of laughter that smoothes the boring parts of the script.
