> From advertisements, it looks like a tale of Simonesque Neil Simonesque with sweet ways with Mary Tyler Moore, Bra, her bra presented the culmination.
Instead, he turns out to be a hilarious film being executed from start to finish.
The concept is deceptively pedestrian.
An adult adult son is looking for his biological parents and meets eccentric characters along the way.
The film shows how good a script and the actors can have a banal idea.
The son and his wife take off in research accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents.
After an impasse advance after the other, each one funnier than the previous one, they end up ending up in new-mexic with his real biological parents: Alan Alda and Lily Tomlin.
It is difficult to condense Mile's intrigue per minute.
Apparently hundreds of scenes jump on each other without giving you a chance to get the last one.
Without giving too much, one of the best episodes implies a federal agent of federal alcohol, tobacco and gay firearms which tries an arrest while rushing on the LSD because its bi-sexual partner is upstairsLicking a woman's armphaire while her husband is in the neighboring room with their traveling companion.
And everything is done in a fairly clean way, almost (well, maybe exactly).
A large cast (Tomlin, Alda, Moore, Ben Stiller, Patricia Arquette, Tea Leoni, George Segal) interacts in a transparent parade of laughter.
Inspired by an Allen Plus Hyper Woody style, the film succeeds beyond expectations.
