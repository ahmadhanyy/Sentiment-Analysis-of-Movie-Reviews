"The Fighting Sullivans" contains a major development of the plot in the last ten minutes that each film guide has considered it good to give.
There was no dramatic tension for me watching the film, because I knew exactly what was going to happen.
And it's the worst thing that can happen before you see a film.
Because of this, I will walk slightly so that I do not spoil it for anyone who reads this criticism, and it would be very advisable to avoid all the other documents concerning this film before having seen it.
 "The Fighting Sullivans" revolves around a family that consists of a mother, a father, a sister and five brothers.
The brothers are very close, despite the occasional disagreement.
They are inseperable and never move away from each other.
Their friendship and loyalty are the foundation of this image.
The first half of the film follows the brothers as young children and their various adventures.
When four of them fight with local boys, the youngest Sullivan, who is inside a church at the time, leaves to help, but not before leaving the chapel correctly.
If I am terribly vague on the details, it is because what I told you is essentially the first hour and a half.
All I can say is going to watch this film, because it is a beautiful portrait of a family that sticks together, through good and evil.
And after seeing the film, you will understand why this criticism was written as it did.
