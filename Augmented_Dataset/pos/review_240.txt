Disaster films tend to be very formulated and very shot.
Seeing a disaster film with real originality, or at least a decent touch, would certainly be a welcome surprise.
Unfortunately, friends are unlikely.
Dante's peak is clich√©, and sometimes cheesy, but also quite decent.
To be honest, I was not very interested in seeing this film, and word of mouth, as well as several criticisms, did not make it promising.
So I was pleasantly surprised than to discover that this film was not bad at all.
It's pretty the Moulin race, but that's not something I would say is only "ok" to look at.
In case you do not know, Dante's peak concerns a volcano and the city that lives in its shadow, the peak of Dante (which would have guessed, huh?).
Pierce Brosnan embodies the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and, perhaps more by intuition than real scientific proof, is determined that the volcano will be held in the very close future.
Due to the lack of more substantial evidence, no one warns the small town, and when they finally do it, it is in the middle of the city meeting that the volcano finally blows.
Brosnan, all around the good guy, will of course save the day.

Or at least the mayor of Dante's Peak (Linda Hamilton).
Naturally, the two will become in love with each other.
 (If you think I just ruined a development of the plot, you have not seen many films!)
There are also practically necessary children and the company dog to shoot your heart ropes.
And of course, children or the dog (at least one or the other) will do something heroic.

But hey, I don't want to spoil all the surprises!
If there was a part of you who hesitated to see Dante's peak simply because it would be a waste of time, I urge you to look at it and decide for yourself.
It's not brain food, but it succeeds what it is supposed to be.

A pleasant film full of suspense on the Fury Mother Nature can be unleashed!
