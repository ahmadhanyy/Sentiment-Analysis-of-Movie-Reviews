TBWP is probably the most profitable film of all time.
Not surprising, given his small budget of US $ 100,000, to date, he has won more than $ 130 million.
It is a shocking profit 100 times!
Rumors that an intelligent "marketing" ploy has been so successful to win cult-type fanatics, by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent criticism, the film has just exploded at the box office, rakingmillion people during his opening weekend.
Shot in 16 mm and video (I suspect.), The film tells the incursions of 3 students who go in search of the legendary Blair Witch.
The public is placed in the first person perspective of all the bad adventure, often wobbly and unclear, sometimes you have to get used to it at first.
It is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 have disappeared; edited and put on the screen for the benefit of our audience.
TBWP is simply smart.
Shot to seem to be really a stock shot by a bunch of students looking for the witch Blair as a school project, we can suspect (like yours really) that it is simply a lazy approachBut intelligent of the making of films.
Simply incredible in this regard, I must say.
Talk about impact, oh yes, TBWP has a lot, in fact, most of the audiences find it deeply disturbing.
I did it, especially the last piece but I do not reveal more.
You must see it for yourself.
I can't help but feel a little cheated after knowing how commercial this film has become.
Could it be that an independent film involuntarily found a formula for the commercial call?
Or was it just a ploy by the big players from the start?
Well, I guess the fact remains; TBWP is very original, intelligent and will certainly leave most with something terrible to speak and think for weeks before watching this film.
No gore, no special effects, I just can't overcome how terribly intelligent this film is!
