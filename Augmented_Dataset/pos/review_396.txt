Shit these trailers.
If there had not been the advertising of this film, which reveals too much of its content, I would have been stuck to "under the sand".
As it stands, the film retains a certain value, thanks to an excellent performance by Charlotte Rampling and a more mature François Ozon in the director's chair.
Marie (Charlotte Rampling) and her husband Jean (Bruno Cremer) relax on the beach.
She takes a nap while he is swimming.
When Marie wakes up, Jean is not found.
She contacts the authorities, but they can't find it either.
Did he disappear to start a new life?
Was he accidentally killed?
Does he commit suicide?
Marie still asks these questions a year later, and to continue her life, she must find answers.
It is a good premise, and this little film uses it at the limit.
The film moves at a quiet pace, a little slow, but relaxing.
It is a very visual story, and you can almost sit down without reading the subtitles.
It is mainly thanks to the excellent camera work by Antoine Héberle and Jeanne Lapoirie, who shot the film in a dream mist, and the main rampling performance.
The rolling is so expressive in its representation of Marie, you instantly connect with her character, despite that she is delusional.
The scenes in which she interacts with her husband, who, according to her, is alive, are heartbreaking.
She can't really overcome it.
They have been married for twenty-five years.
The other actors, in particular Jacques Nolot, are also excellent.
Sex in the film is rather useless, but compared to Ozon's "criminal amateurs", it is the Disney channel.
Probably provoking discussions later, "Under the Sand" is a great film experience.
Although it is difficult to recommend as entertainment, it is a good alternative for adults on how we manage the loss.
Ozon seems to ask what you would do, and this is certainly a question difficult to answer.
