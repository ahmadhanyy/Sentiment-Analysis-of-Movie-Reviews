With the abundance of banal and recycled films in the late 90s, there is a great demand by films lovers (not to mention film critics) for films that present the broad film with something reallyOriginal: perhaps daringly, perhaps purely thematic.
For the first, you do not need to look further than the incredible German thriller by director Tom Tykwer Run Lola Run, a film that could make some viewers need a cooling period afterwards.
Lola, a contemporary Goth Goth with flamboyant red hair, one day receives a desperate telephone call from her boyfriend Manni.
It seems that because she delivered something late, he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand brands, and if he does not deliver a hundred thousand brands in the next twenty minutes, he will be killed.
This gives Lola twenty minutes to find 100,000 brands, or her boyfriend dies.
She therefore runs - not only joggins, sprints - in the hope that in one way or another, she can get money and save a life.
> From there, as the critic Steve Rhodes described it, Run Lola Run plays a bit like "sliding doors on steroids.
With a non-stop techno soundtrack, a bizarre camera work, all kinds of crazy zooms and a really unrestrained rhythm, whoever is bored with Run Lola Run must smoke something.
Indeed, the film is often scandalously exciting, as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious.
Like Titanic, Run Lola Run is a success with cinema much more than it is a success of the film.
The way the film is made, for a pure visual style, Tykwer's film is breathtaking (literally, sometimes).
Thematically, that leaves something to be desired; he plays with intriguing ideas but sometimes seems that there is little substance behind the whole flash.
While you look, it doesn't matter.
Running 81 minutes with sale is a film I wanted was longer because it was so good while it lasted.
It is the equivalent of a russian mountains in the amount of thrills and pleasure it offers.
