Synopsis: In this cultural exploration, a Chinese computer engineer named Fang (Peter Wang) decides to take a month's vacation to visit her sister Mrs.chao (Shen Guanglan), her husband M.CHAO (Hy Xiaoguang), and their teenage daughter Lili (Li Qinqin) in Beijing after 30 years of separation.
Fang brings his Asian American wife Grace (Sharon Iwai) and his university son Paul (Kelvin Han Yee), who do not speak both Chinese.
The meeting between the two families allows the public to compare the oriental and Western cultures as well as the ambitions of the individual characters.
Opinion: Sometimes a film is motivated by the plot.
Sometimes it is a character sketch.
A Great Wall (1986) can be called a culture sketch, as opposed to a character sketch because he gently compares a American Chinese family to a Beijing family.
Fang's family is completely Americanized.
Fang is a professional in the upper middle class who loves jogging and arguing with her boss.
His wife cannot cook Chinese.
His son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism when Fang encourages him to befriend an Asian girl.
Meanwhile, Beijing de Fang's sister advocates absolute loyalty to the work unit. '
Her husband is a retired official who heard rumors of American depravity (homosexuals who direct the streets), and his daughter Lili aspires to American freedoms in a culture of youth where to study for entrance exams to college isThe most important thing in life.
The two families spend a month learning slowly on each other.
There is no ultimate understanding of "response" or final after a month's vacation.
The film is neither here nor there; it is a neutral, sinuous, sweet portrait of life on both sides.
