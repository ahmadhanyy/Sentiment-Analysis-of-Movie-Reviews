 "How do you know when you have finished making love?"
-Jackson Pollock to a journalist from Life magazine to recognize when you have a painting
Jackson Pollock's "Making Love" quote is famous, but in the same breath, he said a more constructive thing, "it's like looking at a bed of flowers - saying your hair on what it means."
It took him sixteen words to do because the entire dissertations tried and failed: assimilate God and abstract art and offer a kind of comfort in reversals to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept.
The biopic _pollock_, the beginnings of director of actor Ed Harris, reflects the second bacon of his in the way he accepts the creations of Pollock in the framework of the order of things, and should also disarm the hatefuls of the beautiful-Arts.
Undoubtedly more than any other living actor, Harris, who also plays _pollock_, embodies the stiff archetypal work, and his demystification of the blue collars of art with a high work intensity of Pollock, both as a interpreter and director, makes cinema unpretentious.
 (From what I know of Harris, he, like Pollock, was not born gifted or lucky; rather, a strong work ethics is the seed of his success.)
Admittedly, it is possible that _pollock_ alienate these same viewers perplexed by the imponderable "goal" of the series of Pollock splash: the common thread between them is a lack of editorialization.
The film _pollock_ is all looks and silent exchanges dotted with anger attacks, but the motivations are left to our own perceptions.
And it is a friendly film but not completely indulgent, as illustrated by a discouraging conclusion.
_Pollock_ sums up the period during which he fought a lost battle against personal demons (alcoholism, depression and the general miseries of an artist) while finding a place of expression subconscious.
A brief introduction to Pollock's drunken unleashed team is located in his affeposition by a colleague artist from New York, Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden, rewarded an Oscar for best support actress for this brilliant performance), who worksThe exterior-in, pre-intellectualizationchaque stroke of its brush.
In a scene after having moved together and established adjacent studios, she asks what he hopes to achieve on his last canvas, grilling him on the interaction of cubism and surrealism until he says: "You paint theFucking things "and leaves in a breath.
As they got married, she became her de facto manager; it is the form of function and chaos marrying discipline, a very harmonious collision.
 (Krasner denies a baby to him, indicating that it would upset the balance.)
Such a union is intended to implode, and I hope that I will not ruin the _pollock_ experience saying that it is.
Although he is never represented as a very romantic wedding to start - Pollock and his wife channeled their passions elsewhere - their symbiosis is picked after several years, and that comes back to Krasner suffering from one of the Pollock overnight known:"You are killing!
you're killing me !
you're killing me !"
 (Aside: Harris' own wife, Amy Madigan, is unrecognizable and exceptional as Diva Galerie Peggy Guggenheim.)
Pollock himself goes to Dalliances with younger women like Ruth Klingman (the Torrid Jennifer Connelly), hoping, an assumes, to catch the revitalizing puff of youth.
I love Jackson Pollock stuff and I am also in love with Harris' _pollock_.
It's scrappy and obuvan T; no coincidence according to which his minor failures are only occasional invasive development, like Jeff Beal's score but no less lamentable - I cannot imagine that Pollock, or anyone, would hang on this music, whichPut into soundtracks filling gaps before completing Leimages.
One of my favorite sequences is a strangely silent reconstruction of Hans Namuth who draws this famous Pollock images at East Hampton, Long Island; the mounting tension is almost comical, because Namuth continues to interrupt the Pollock process to recharge hisCamera or take a break for dinner.
A more experienced director could have been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal.
