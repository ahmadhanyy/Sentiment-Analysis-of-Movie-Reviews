Edward Zwick's "seat" raises more questions than they can answer convincingly or even clearly articulated.
Its subject is the growing threat of terrorism in American cities.
Denzel Washington is Anthony "Hub" Hubbard, who manages the FBI anti -terrorist working group in New York.
His investigation into Arabic terrorist cells intensifies when suicide suicide bombers remove a bus from people.
Hub focuses on a mysterious CIA agent (Annette Bening), including the fact "Elise" and "Sharon".
While terrorist attacks continue and the number of bodies increases, the question of martial law is raised.
Enter General Devereaux (Bruce Willis), who opposes martial law at the start, but who, as soon as the president decides to send to the army, begins to develop Arab immigrants in a prison camp and attackEach link that Hub discovers in the terrorist chain.
HUB listens to Devereaux torture and murdered a suspect.
The future offering Zwick and screenwriter Lawrence Wright is too possible.
What would happen, ask them, if terrorism became as much a daily life in New York as in cities like Beirut and Belfast?
What would happen to our civil freedoms if soldiers patrol our streets with machine guns?
These questions "The Siege" answer in realistic details.
However, this implies most difficult: what can we do to fight terrorism without sacrificing justice and freedom?
If we encourage terrorism abroad (from the character of Being, we discover that the CIA formed the bombers), will it inevitably return?
 "Siege" avoids the most difficult questions by giving his hero, Hub, with a feeling without compromise of good and clear evil.
This comforting fantasy of Sir Galahad confronted with the evils of the modern world is an escape from the problems that arouse the reflection that the film raises.
However, Zwick deserves the merit of having at least tackled the problem with as much realism as it is so many films (the "Die Hard" series by Willis, for example) only offer a comic strip on terrorism.
