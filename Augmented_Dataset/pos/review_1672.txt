I suppose that there are those who have never been kissed before (a rare and dying breed), unless you are a child? In this case, he would be called experimentation.
The rarest are always those who have never been kissed before reaching the 1920s.
The most difficult to believe is that Drew Barrymore has never been kissed.
Despite all these songs of titles difficult to believe, there are people who have never really been kissed, and who always wait for this good person to give them the warm and sloppy feeling of languages mixing, reassuring that their search for real'love is over.
Well, this film talks about a girl waiting for the good boy to kiss her in her life.
And it's soft.
Drew Barrymore who shone? Still after 'is wonderful as? Josie, Grossy', the Dweeb high school which became a professional editor, before being awarded by his newspaper to return to school as an infiltrated journalist.
He addresses the questions of how a dweeb becomes a ball queen and finds the man of his life in a single session.
Difficult to believe, but possible.
There may also be those who have been kissed before, but in fact, never really gave the kiss.
So, this film can be watched by those who wait for true love or those who are still looking for it.
Anyway, it's a pleasant sit, with an end of fairy tale.
