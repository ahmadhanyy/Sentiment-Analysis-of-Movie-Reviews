Usually a film talks about something more than a soiled carpet, but not the big Lebowski.
The new offer of the creators of the 1996 Fargo critical hit is entertaining to say the least.
Originality has always been a strong line in Coen Brother's films, and the great Lebowski is incredibly original.
It starts quite strangely when Jeff "the guy" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is confused with a millionaire, Jeff "The Big" Lebowski (David Huddleston), who is the woman, Bunny (Tara Reid) owes money throughout thecity.
Two henchmen, to recover on Bunny's debt in the guy's house.
They try to recover the money that Bunny owes to them and one of them urinates on his carpet.
The next day, MEC explains his situation to his bowling team (Steve Buscemi and John Goodman, respectively.
It is advisable to go to the Big Lebowski and make him pay the soiled carpet.
He does it, and shortly after, he is attached in a removal caper.
It is an extremely funny film with a lot of moments of laughing from the belly.
The Coen brothers have gathered a large casting that is played out perfectly.
Also several major roles of support, John Turturro as a child attacking the bowling player named Jesus.
The coen script takes place perfectly and everything goes together to make it extremely entertaining.
I doubt that this film is almost as popular as Fargo, but its moments out of the wall have so far the best of 1998.
If you like something other than the Coen brothers have done, you will love it, otherwise they try it, it's a little different.
