Susan Granger review on "Hearts in Atlantis" (Castle Rock / Warner Bros.)
The timing is everything, and the timing seems just for this poignant psychological drama which combines the nostalgia for the maturity of "stand by me" with the mystical power of "The Green Mile".
Based on Stephen King Stories adapted by screenwriter William Goldman and directed by Scott Hicks, he took place in 1960 in Harwich, Connecticut, where Bobby Garfield, 11, aged 11 (Anton Yelchin), lives in a pension (Hope Davis).
He is devoted to his friends in the neighborhood (Mika Boorem, Will Rothhaar) but his pivotal relationship is with a new strange tenant, Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refused to buy himA birthday gift and stretches it, instead, a library card.
Knowing that he aspires to a Schwinn bicycle, Ted offers to pay him $ 1 per week to read the local newspaper for him and keep his eyes open for signs of malicious and malicious men who pursue him to exploit his special powers.
The structure of history consists of a long flashback, supervised by the present, featuring the adult bobby (David Morse), minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the mysterious character of the Hopkins human drama is mine, sensitive and attractive benignment.
The only explanation is that it is a medium that is sought by the FBI to help in search of the Communists and even it seems appropriate, given the inexplicable state of the world at the moment.
The production values and the performance are solid, in particular Hopkins - undoubtedly the most beautiful and versatile actor of our time - and the children with whom he forges a firm link.
On the Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "Hearts in Atlantis" is a melancholic 8 8, evolving with a subtle power of an emotionally effective Catharsis.
