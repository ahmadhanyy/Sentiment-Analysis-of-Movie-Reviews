Charlie Sheen plays the role of Zane, a radio-astronomer who listens to the sounds of other forms of life.
When he finally gets one, his boss destroys the band and pulls it.
Naturally, Zane is not ready to abandon, and he offers an ingenious way to do so himself.
He is helped by a young child in the neighborhood and they discover that the sound comes from Mexico.
Thus, Zane goes there to investigate and collides with a student lady why the temperature of the earth has dangerously increased so suddenly.
Zane has marital problems at the time, and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting.
To hear Charlie Sheen Deliver the line, "I suppose that there is something to say for celibacy" is the funniest thing I have ever heard in a film since Matthew Broderick discussed the asexual reproduction in thewar games.
This is only the configuration, and I do not want to give too much, because a large part of the pleasure of the films is the surprises.
Charlie Sheen, who has had a difficult career lately, has been in great shape here.
He is funny, serious and determined to achieve his goal.
The absolutely formidable performance of Sheen is another big advantage of this film.
The story is ingeniously designed by Twohy, which also wrote and directed the just as smart cable film Grand Tour: Disaster in Time.
The major defect in the films is a very slow pace, and it does not go much in the first.
Viewers can become restless for a while, but believe me, if you stay and keep your head in it, you will have a good time.
