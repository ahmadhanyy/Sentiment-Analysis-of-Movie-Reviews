Trees Lounge is the start of the director of one of my favorite actors, Steve Buscemi.
He gave memorable performances in soup, fargo and reservoir dogs.
Now he tries his hand to write, make and act in the same film.
The film begins terribly slow with Tommy (Buscemi) dragging around a local bar the "living room of trees" and harassing his brother.
It is obvious that he was a loser.

I really liked this film even if he did not reach my expectations.
After seeing it in Fargo and tank dogs, you know it is capable of better performance.
I think his brother, Michael, did an excellent job for his debut.
M .buscemi left for a good career as a director!
