This is a curious thing - I discovered that when Willis is not called to wear the whole film, it is much better and the film too.
Even if, in the sixth sense, he is the "name", he does not have the central role.
This honor goes to Haley Osment who plays Cole Sear (cute word game, seeing) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts.
If the osment was cute or precious, the director who went for the Maudlin, it would be nothing more than a film of the week, fortunately, the osment is not only better than that, but in some cases,Everyone deviates from the chanters of a performance by Bravura.
We see his fears, his vulnerabilities, his forces and his intelligences which give the sixth sense one of the best films I saw this year.
The whole casting corresponds to the quality, Willis giving a fairly low performance which corresponds to the object.
One thing about this film, its target.
It is not a sfxfest like The HAUNTING or a Gorefest, it's more what I would call a supernatural drama, more interested in the characters than to dazzle you with makeup.
A warning: there is a great turn in the film, something like the usual suspects, where you end up replaying the film in your head rethink what you have just seen.
I was very lucky to see him as an overview in Toronto, before any media or critical criticism was released, so I went without prejudice.
If someone wants to talk about the film before you see it, don't leave them.
Let the director explain at his own pace and you will appreciate the film much more.
