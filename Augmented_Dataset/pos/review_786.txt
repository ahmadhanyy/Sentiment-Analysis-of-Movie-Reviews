The first thing you notice about this film is that it is cold.
Placed in Minnesota and Dakota from the North during the winter, many scenes take place outside with long scenes of snowy soil on a white background.
What we need as Bloomington is struggling with the long endless cold night.
As with most coen brothers films, this has bizarre characters in harmful patterns, each operating as strangely as possible.
A car seller hires a few caps to kidnap his wife so that he can recover his father's ransom.
Along the way, anything that can be wrong.
In brief scenes of vicious violence, people are shot through their heads, in the back, face, chest and various other areas of anatomy.
There is also one of the most unpleasant body elimination scenes to date on the screen.
Remarkably, most of the film is played to laugh.
Even more remarkable, it works.
The only friendly person in the film is very pregnant sheriff (Frances McDormand) who tracks the killers while eating all possible opportunities.
With each good film, the public acquires new knowledge.
Here you learn things.
Everyone in Minnesota speaks in a boring managing accent that would drive you crazy.
And do not make a violent illegal company with losers of low -life amorae foam.
Oh yeah, if you get shot, using a towel to decorate brilliantly to stop the bleeding, just give you the clumsy look.
