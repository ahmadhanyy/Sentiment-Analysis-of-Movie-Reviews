Exceptionally managed by Gus Van Sant, "Good Will Hunting" overcomes the banalities of its history by affirming the emergence of new fresh talents.
The film features Matt Damon as hunting as a mathematical and rebellious kid discovered by Inadvert by a university professor (Stellan Skarsgard), who places him under psychological supervision with Robin Williams.
In a word, that's all.
The nucleus of the "good will to hunt" is Damon, which infuses the script (co-written by "Ben Affleck" of Amy with just the good amount of heat, sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position of interpreterMulti-talently refreshing.
But it is the game that strikes the brand, and Damon hits all the good grades, flying over the already role of Robin Williams ("Awakenings" was written everywhere) as a devastated shrink who closed all contacts with societyDue to the tragic death of the wife.
Damon effortlessly mixes the carileness of a gregarious and confused thug with someone's absorbing ingenuity like Einstein.
Its rich and complex character is the pulp of "good will to hunt".
Everything else pale in comparison.
