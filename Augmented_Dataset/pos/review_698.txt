Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:
the matrix
What's worse than Y2K?
How about an entirely digital future where nothing is real?
This is what the computer programmer Neo (Keanu Reeves) learns slowly when he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix, a film directed by the Wachowski brothers (the guys behind the thriller of the bound hip).
Before moaning in the presence of Reeves in the main role, hold on.
There is actually a story with depth here.
It seems that a group of pirates is there to stop the system which is the matrix, directed by the Bald but brilliant Laurence Fishburne and helped by Carrie Ann Moss, who looks pretty cool in leather, I must say.
Neo (Reeves) is roughly a key actor in this fight, although he really doesn't look at him at the start.
Could this amateur be "the one" as Fisburne thinks?
Create the Wachowskis for having set up a great story that allows suspense to build, something that few special films loaded with effects seem to make these days.
There are a lot of effects to make, of course, but at least there is also a dorsal spine on which to build them.
Reeves is surprisingly good in his role as Neo, in particular in a combat scene with Fishburne which appears as clumsy, but brilliant.
I hope that the bad guys were not so "generic" (the leftover G of the search for an adorable science fiction actuator with many hitchhiker camera angles and, of course, a mother profile ofAn explosion of helicopter.
Now the Wachowskis are heading for horror films with their next project.
Bring it.
