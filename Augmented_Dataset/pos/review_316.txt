Synopsis: engaged in an asylum, the Marquis de Sade (Rush) continues to publish pornographic literature, helped by the young maid Madeleine (Winslet).
Abbe Coulmier (Phoenix), who runs the hospital, disapproves of the stories, but the man in the hope of making a remedy.
The crafts and life of Sade are threatened when the emperor sends Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) to stop the work of the Marquis, permanently.
Review: "Quills" is an exploration of the Marquis de Sade: his madness, his cruelty and her perversion, his obsession with sex in any form whatsoever, as obscene.
But the "feathers" also detail the determination of the Marquis: writing despite the obstacles put on your way and spread your words to the masses.
The extent to which of Sade is willing to go to practice his job is among the most intriguing elements of the film, as when Sade Scribe a story in his own blood, or tells a story via a chain of prisoners of prisoners, cell cellsto the cell.
To provide a contrast to the Marquis, Wright involves it with two very different characters.
One is the abbot, a beautiful, charming and kindly man whose desires are blocked by his oath to God.
The abbot covets for Madeleine, but it is the Marquis of the Attacking who can have it.
And then there is Royer-Collard, a hypocrite which, in truth, is as sadistic as all the Hotley creations of the Marquis.
Rush is splendid like Sade, completely living in the character.
Kaufmanâ€™s management is good, and it is able to bring a bizarre feeling of humor to the disaster procedure.
The intrigue itself is rather commonplace and takes place without surprise, but this is practically unimportant.
For two hours, "Quills" familiarizes us with the Marquis de Sade - and, even more frightening, allows us to brief overview of his scatological soul.
