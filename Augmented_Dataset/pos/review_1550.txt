Almost a complete decade before Steven Spielberg's wild soldier Ryan asked him if a film could be both "anti-war" and "pro-soldier", Hamburger Hill by John Irvin proved him.
Lost in the flood of the praise of criticism that praised Oliver Stone's peloton, this excellent film was rejected as "too militarist".
It is difficult to understand exactly why --- unless I amvin, by assembling his heterogeneous collection of young men who, for predictable (and often naive) reasons, "have chosen to present themselves" for the debacle of Vietnam, --refused to present to us Lestone Killer, Psycho-Psycho and Ruthless Opposite who became for the epics of the Vietnam War which "The Polack, The Hillbilly and the Kid of Brooklyn" became in the films of the Second Warglobal.
Hamburger Hill, based on a true story, is not an easy -to -watch film.
There is a scene that will have grisons anti-war warning warning on their seats or who move towards real tears.
And the final assault on the "hill" in question is visually confusing.
Gristly realities are presented in brief lightnings, as if the brain did not dare recognized what it had encountered.
And in the mud and smoke officer, veteran and "beginner", the black soldier and white, become almost indistinguishable from each other, as they do in the chaos of real fight.
The game is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by Courtney B. Vance as a doc - in a role that will have very categorically incredulous that it is the same actor that they applauded that "Seaman Jones" in the red Octoberfrom McTiernan.
If you have seen the Ryan soldier, you have to see Hamburger Hill - if only to determine that all the value and horror of Spielberg's vision were also present in the Ashau valley that she'was in Omaha Beach.
