When I heard for the first time that Romeo and Juliet had been "updated", I shivered.
I thought that another Shakespeare classic had been destroyed.
Fortunately, I was wrong.
Baz Luhrman made a "in your face" and a visually magnificent piece with this film.
It revolves around the two rival families who, in this version, each run of companies of several million dollars.
These rival companies / families are Capulet and Montague.
The young generation of these two families has formed gangs, which despise each other.
As the scenarios say, Romeo Montague (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet Capulet (Claire Danes) meet during a fantasy party, and it is love on the first site.
I never believed that love on the first site was possible until I saw this film, the scene in which Romeo's eyes meet Juliet through the aquarium is one of the most memorable.
Of course, they cannot publicly reveal their love, because their families are arc enemies.
So they get married in secret, this is where things are starting to be mistaken.
History, as for all good Shakespeare, ends with a tragedy.
Cinematography is spectacular to say the least, and the soundtrack offers the perfect atmosphere in which "poses our scene", as the film says.
There is very little to criticize.
The performances are convincing, and several of the film's young stars can see that it provides a launch for their careers.
The modernization of the script is ingenious and intelligent.
Despite the well -known scenario, this latest version still manages to provoke tears among many public members (especially the young generation), and it is certainly a great credit for the film.
