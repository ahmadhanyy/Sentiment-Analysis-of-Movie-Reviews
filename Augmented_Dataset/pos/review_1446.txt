"A Private Matter" is based on the true history of Sherri Finkbine and the events of his life in the 1960s.
After getting pregnant (for the fifth time), she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously distorted her unborn child.
She and her husband decide, with the help of her doctor, to have an abortion.
But it is the 1960s, and abortion is illegal.
His doctor has made arrangements to have the procedure carried out with the law, claiming that the child endangers the life of the mother.
Everything is about to work very well, until Sherri has the uncontrollable desire to talk about his situation with a local journalist.
This triggers a media frenzy and immediately Sherri is the most hated woman in the world.
She and her husband are dismissed from their work, journalists surround their house at any time, and above all, no one in the country (and possibly other countries) will proceed to abortion.
This causes emotion problems for all those involved.
 "A private affair" is a fascinating story and it is hard to believe that it happened about 30 years ago.
It is only a defect, it is that there is not once a satisfactory confrontation with Sherri and one of his opponents.
A woman passing her in the street the Tel to burn in hell, and when Sherri shouts appropriately, "just tell me what I am supposed to do", the woman has no answer.
No one apparently had an answer, they just wanted to control what should only have been the choice of Sherri and her husband.
This is an important film, tell an important story.
It is not only a question of not wanting another child, it is a question of not wanting a child who will cause serious changes in his family, none of whom could be beneficial.
Sydney Pollack was an executive producer for this HBO film.
