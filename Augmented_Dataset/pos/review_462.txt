Well, I admit that when I heard about this film (which was before Dante's peak), I could just feel what "Twister" had started.
So now, it seems that we are in a full return to the era of films in the event of a disaster of the 1970s.
With "Twister", "Dante's Peak", "Volcano" and soon "flood" and "Titanic" extremely expensive by James Cameron
I would first say that I appreciated the "volcano" much more than "Dantes Peak".
Part of this is simply biased because I generally appreciate everything that Tommy Lee Jones appears.
I read a lot on the film being "Cheezy" or "Hokey" and I really did not see or thought once during the whole film.
I can easily get bored and this film did not bother me for a minute.
Another thing, and my boy groans me today!, It bothers me, it's when criticism and others go "well it's not really possible".
you know what ?
I couldn't give a fucking blood if possible or not, really I couldn't.
It's a scary film and I don't want reality to be thrown into my face.
I want to be able to see the impossible, everything could "and if" many criticisms have seen one to many films!
Special effects are the second star of this functionality.
They are so incredible that I had trouble believing that they were indeed FX and that it did not burn on the ground.
They did an incredible job and come the time for the Oscars (if they remember it), it is better to be thrown there.
