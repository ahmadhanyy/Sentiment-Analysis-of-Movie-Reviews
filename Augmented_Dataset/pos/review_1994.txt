Richard Gere can be a commander actor, but he is not always in great films.
Everything meets here.
Gere is a great defense lawyer of Chicago who takes an apparently independent case in the hope of even more advertising.
It doesn't happen exactly as he expects.
Gere's client, Aaron (Edward Norton), is a shy boy from Tennessee who is accused of having murdered and mutilated a brutally Catholic archbishop.
The evidence is stacked against him.
He was surprised to run the scene covered in the bishop's blood.
His bloody imprints are everywhere on the murder scene.
He has a relationship with the priest.
Gere speaks to the boy, believes that he is actually innocent and starts to find the real killer.
Despite the proclamations of the lawyer according to which he does not care about the guilt of his customers and that the real thrill plays with people's lives, he gets involved with Aaron and is determined to release him.
Lots of complications and twists and turns.
The lawyer for the prosecution is the former colleague and in love with Gere.
They both work the motivations for their legal advantages and it becomes disorderly.
His boss had major economic relations with the archbishop that has become sour and seems to have criminal ties.
Aaron becomes more bizarre and stranger over the trial.
The case of Gere collapses and he faces a dozen ethical dilemmas.
Gere is exceptional as a well -dressed advisor, but only once, I wanted to see him relax and get out of his "costume" character.
Even when he loses it, you don't see very far inside.
Aaron de Norton is convincing: he appears to be the kid of Backwoods ill -placed in the big city.
The support casting does an excellent work to maintain history.
As with most effective dramas in the audience room, cinematography is clear and rich.
The story will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Nothing is what it seems.
