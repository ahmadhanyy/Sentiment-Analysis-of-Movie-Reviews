The 30 -second HAPPY BASTARD review:
American pie
Raunch summer continues to spread in theaters with this last Yuk festival, filled with sick jokes and dialogues for adolescents.
If you expect Dawson's Creek, you are in a problem.
If your expectations are lower (and better, I could add), you will appreciate the hell of the American pie.
The film throws several unknowns, the only real recognizable being the own levy of Eugene de SCTV as a happy father.
The story revolves around four high school seniors which has a goal before the school year is flowing.
That is just about everything.
Throughout the film, the small pieces of sick comics are sprinkled throughout, including a memorable scene involving a apple pie (I won't give it, but you probably know what it is) and an internet showHorribly bad.
Of course, the film has slightly sentimental bits, but they do not drag the humor content of the film as bad.
Most of the actors do their job, but it is Levy who is a hoe, a father who tries to talk about sex with his son with the help of curious "visual aid".
I couldn't stop laughing during this film, and if you can endure all the raunch and sexual references, then American Pie is for you.
If you are one of these "conservative" types, well, I bet you have fun while, South Park and Austin Powers II play in theaters, now is it?
