Niagara Niagara (R) Niagara Niagara by Bob Gosse follows a plan that is not like many young lovers on the road.
Wild Marcy (Robin Tunney) and Calm Seth (Henry Thomas) meet cute, literally colliding while flying in a local store.
A few scenes later, the two embarked on a trip to Toronto of their little nameless American town in search of a rare doll that Marcy desperately wants.
Along the way, true love inevitably flowers.
What distinguishes Niagara Niagara, however, is that Marcy is afflicted from Tourette syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscles and vocal tics.
Tunney, displaying a range of actor who is not allowed to hear in the Thriller of the teenage witch The Craft, offers an amazing performance which earned her the prize for the best actress at the Venice Film Festival last year.
To call her work, a tour of force, it is not to imply that she attacks the landscape; the effectiveness of Tunney is in its modulation and vulnerability, which makes its representation of Marcy's disease - whichOften acts violently - which is more convincing and tragic.
She and the nicely subtle Thomas develop a gently innocent and deliciously offbeat chemistry.
Their journey strikes a few difficult points in a creative way along the way, mainly the fault of the writer Matthew Weiss.
A detour involving a widowed widowhood (Michael Parks) who takes the couple puts the screaming story, and the key figure of a Happy-Happy pharmacist (Stephen Lang) is very incredible.
But these false steps do not move the power of the Tour of Bravura de Tunney, which transports Niagara Niagara to a level of peak that it would not have reached otherwise.

It's like something you continue so long, but you don't know how to react when you get it.
I still don't know how to react. "
