Ingredients: pouring rain, small flooded town, damn burst, the bad guys who are after millions of dollars
Synopsis: At a given moment in history, the city dweller Karen asks the hero Tom what happened to his church.
It responds to something like: "The church is flooded but at least flood waters turn off the big fire.
Well, the fire was not so bad because, while the church was burning, the looters apparently thought it was sure enough to unravel all the invaluable stained glass. "

Suddenly, his security truck carrying more than three million dollars is stuck in the flooded street and is made by armed looters.
Tom has no choice but to grasp the bag full of money, hide it and swim for his life.
This makes it an action film full of jet ski, prosecution on speed boats and firearm battles, while Tom tries to escape and surpass corrupt cops and armed looters untilWhat the National Guard can respond to its call for distress.
He is friendly and helped by a young woman church in the city church named Karen (Minnie Driver).

Will Tom and Karen survive natural and artificial disasters?
Opinion: Do not expect stimulating problems or dramatics.
There is not much more in this film than to hide, to run, to swim, to shoot and to save handcuffed heroes of drowning, but that is what makes him escape and fun.
Relax, remove your shoes and take out the popcorn.
