I tried hard and not like this film without succeeding.
It contains games of Breging Baby, any Hepburn / Tracy film, which is part of the intrigue of the War Games, Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in his daughter Friday, the action of the elevator well, the action by trainand murder.
It's cute, funny, full of suspense (a little), sexy (a little).
One of the bad guys was a surprise.
The pace is quite fast, there are "action" scenes.
I think it's a reasonable family summer film for families with older children who have already seen Maverick.
Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte are well separately and together.
I really identified myself with the character of Julia Roberts (want to think, I know!), But I have better hair!
Her hair, a very dull dark brown, have no color.
She could use some protruding facts.
They both do their roles well: she is a bored columnist with the Chicago Chronicle and she is a journalist of "Cub" Hotshot with the Chicago Globe.
They have a lot of fun trying to manage to resolve a case throughout this film.
I like the focus of a story.
The other actors include Charles Martin Smith as boss of Roberts, Olympia Dukakis as a colleague from Nolte, Nora Dunn also with the Chronicle, and Marsha Mason as a deputy.
Basically, this film is reasonably fun.
There is a serious mystery to solve, and I appreciated following a fun couple to solve the mystery.
It is a pleasant change in rhythm compared to the films that are taken seriously.
I give high comedy marks.
