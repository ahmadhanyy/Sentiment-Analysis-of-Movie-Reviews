Kolya is one of the richest films I have seen for some time.
Zdenek Sverak embodies an old confirmed bachelor (who is likely to remain so), who finds his life as a Czech cellist increasingly touched by the five -year -old boy he takes care of.
Although it ends rather suddenly - and I cry, because I wanted to spend more time with these characters - the values of actor, writing and production are as high as, if not higher, comparable American dramas.
This father -and -fails delight - Sverak also wrote the script, while his son, Jan, made - won a Golden Globe for the best foreign language film and, a few days after I saw him, II left an Oscar.
In Czech and Russian, with English subtitles.
