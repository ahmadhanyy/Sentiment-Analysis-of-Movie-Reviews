If I had to trace a graph of the year against cinema-clot-radiculity for = Hollywood films, you will probably see a line with a constant gradient.
= Now, if I had to trace this same graphic for the films as the Michael = Bay / Jerry Bruckheimer has done in the past 4 years, this line would be = exponential growing.
The team started with Will Smith's vehicle = Bad Boys which was no more than a 2-hour action-free video, however entertaining.
Then came the rock, where the public was displayed = to see Nicholas Cage teaming up with Sean Connery against a little terrorizing = fighting in general for a stupid cause.
Con-air was ridiculous stupid in his premise, but he had fun moments, and which can forget the cr√®che = Royme sang by this psycho-tale played by Steve Buscemi.
Although these = films worked because there was something better to cover dirt, = Armageddon does not.
Just like a deep impact, a meteor heads towards the earth and they only realized at 18 days from the impact.
Deep Impact settled with = the size of the modest meteors as large as the city of New York but Armageddon = had to be larger .... good
About the size of Texas (this little meteor = which should probably hit the earth from its orbit!).
Panic of this = observe stimulates the idea of landing people on the meteor, to pierce it then = nuke it (seems familiar) and which to do such a job than Harry = Stamper (Bruce Willis), your own drillerExtraordinary oil and your team of macho-missifits, breastfeeding the slogan "There is nothing on = this planet that Harry cannot pierce! '.
During these 18 days, the Harry group was = divided into 2 teams, trained for the flight in deep space and finally exploded = in space with special drilling vehicles on 2 new space shuttles.
Armageddon's main relational drama is formed in Harry's relationship, A.J
and grace.
To give you an idea, A.J
Works = for Harry, and likes Grace, Harry's daughter.
The problem is that Harry = hates seeing his daughter hang around around a scouring groan like him = for the rest of his life.
So while A.J
And Harry struts, Grace = is placed in a position where she is unable to take sides, so she remains = sitting in the NASA control tower, crying on both in about 80% = from the film.
The human elements that this film is trying to inject itself proves to be nothing more = than a simple excuse for more slowed down and gold.
The anxiety of the world is potrayed with scenes of praying people, running = for their life or simply sitting always by looking at the sky, sounds good = right?
I know, but he looks too much in his place on the screen, too staged.
If = you had to ask yourself: "What is the difference between Armageddon and = a R&B clip?"
You have probably just said "music.".
Not = surprising since Michael Bay is a child of this industry and in fact managed to transpose his skills MTV to detect successfully.
Sound = the foray into Armageddon simply proves that it does not stop.
Well, there is really not much to summarize here.
The = Stock-Aitken-Waterman of Hollywood films has screened their art form = ridiculous, beyond the credibility of the plane, where people = always accept even if they did not believe.
The deep impact was ridiculous in most aspects and I believe that manufacturers know it.
The fact is that they have decided = to link myth and fantasy with a purely credible human history of = suffer and come in terms of problems, which, ultimately, brought it over the ashes in which he s'was initially put.
= Armageddon, is a overcrowded, noisy, disorderly, manipulated absurd = waste of silver and deserves to stay in this same heap of ashes .. = 20
If you plan to look at this on a deep impact because of Liv = Tyler, Bruce Willis or the slogan "The creators of" The Rock "!!".
= Please take a deep impact before finishing its race, I It can be the only one = meteor that is worth looking over in long time.
If you should see, please bring earplugs and aspirins (for dizziness).
Expect that Armageddon = LD is at retail at $ 19 .90 at Carrefour Come on the exit time.
Gee ...... even
= It is not worth it!
