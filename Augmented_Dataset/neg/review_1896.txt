What did they think of?
Nostalgia for the 70s is quite bad, but do we really need a film from the 80s?
Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) wanted to be a rock and roll star, but in 1985, he sings in weddings and had a good time.
Romantic in the soul, he loves weddings and is about to marry his darling in high school.
When she lets him wait at the altar, her melody changes into "love stinks".
He meets the waitress Julia (Drew Barrymore) who is engaged to a seller of unwanted connections and you know that they will come together.
In fact, you know everything that will happen during this film.
Sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading role, but there is no spark.
Barrymore does not seem to be able to transmit something other than a pretty face with nothing behind: Beauty but no attitude.
The two characters are right there.
Steve Buscemi's bits and Jon Lovitz fly the show.
The 80s are pushed on our face.
References to Deloreans, Madonna, "Dallas", Ivana and Donald, Burt and Loni and "Miami vice" become old.
The filmmakers had to realize that there was not much entertainment in history and thought that they could dazzle the public with allusions at humorous period.
They are not funny and it does not work.
With the change on all the fronts accelerating more and more, nostalgia seems to have a big attraction, but do not think that we could be over 14 years old before seeing the past.
Perhaps we can hope for a film next year to nostalgically pouring out about El Nino.
 (Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it was.)
