I never wrote a criticism for a film that I did not watch throughout, but I had to make an exception with powder.
I had about forty-five minutes after this one with a friend when he and his brother entered a huge cry match that would have ended up violence if we had not left the house.
So I have never been able to finish the film and I am sure that hell will not pay three dollars more to watch half a bad film.
But I can at least get a partial exam, because I saw enough to know that it was not worth it to be finished in the first place.
Cinema focuses on a bizarre teenager who has spent his whole life in the cellar of his grandparents' house.
When grandfather dies (taking her department store with him), social worker Mary Steenburgen must take powder (first and intermediary?
Gold Bond) to a state house, where we discover that it is different from other children.
In fact, we discover that it is different when we see it for the first time, because he is the paleest individual we have ever seen and in addition, he has no body hair.
When the powder was born in the first minutes of the film, the father looks at him and says "it's not my son".
obviously .
All I want to know is where the pillesbury dough boy was nine months ago.
Thus, the white face monster leaves its Ranch Neverland for the state house and faces the ridiculous other children.
In other words, until they try to loudly during his first cafeteria lunch by making him "wear" his spoon ("you can either wear it on your nose or in the ass."
Ah, make decisions ...) and he uses telepathic powers to draw all silverware in the room in a giant battery in the middle of the table.
So if his father is the boy of Pillsbury dough, his mother must be the character of Carrie de Sissy Spacek.
And you have to take into account two other things from the following scenes, because we discover that the powder has a kind of super-intelligence ("Your I. Q.
The test went directly from the table! ")
And attracts electrical energy.
This first appears when the powder visits the world of high school (if he is already a genius, why would he need a secondary studies?) And located through a demonstration in the science class of Jeff Goldblum.
Goldblum branches a "Jacob scale" device which shows the current current of two wires and immediately the current circulates on the part and in the chest of the powder.
But Goldblum stands there for about thirty seconds looking at, instead of simply disconnecting the fucking thing.
I guess he was too busy thinking why he appeared in his third consecutive bad film (after Hideaway and nine months).
That's almost everything I saw before the start of the big fight and, let me tell you, it was twice as interesting as the film itself.
But as I said, I saw enough to know that it would be one of these terrible melodramas on the isolation of people who have superior capacities and how difficult it is for these people of S 'Assimilate in dominant civilization.
None of these films properly manage the subject, introducing rather the weak beauty and the beast with a beautiful woman falls in love with the personality of the guy, overlooking her personal appearance.
I had already chosen the female character (the girl who was sitting next to him at the back of the play during the scene of the electrocution), but I suppose that I will never know with certainty what happened.
