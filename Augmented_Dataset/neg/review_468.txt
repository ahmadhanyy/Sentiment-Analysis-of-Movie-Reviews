Sometimes you would think EDTV would be an entertaining film.
I mean, who can resist the story of your average Joe to become a celebrity by filming your life every minute of every day?
But this average Joe, Ed Perkuny, (Matthew McConaughay), is a Sappy and lifeless creation that is walking, trying to solve everyone's problems and solve his own.
McConaughay is horrible, especially because he tries to remove his usual Hollywood charm with a 3 -week beard and torn jeans.
Frankly, he had more charm in the flop devastating the Newton Boys.
He exaggerates in all respects: his overexate body language, the obsession to kiss women every second, he has the opportunity, and this clich√© scene where he loses someone in his life, and falls to the kneeAnd cry.
The rest of the distribution is very good; especially Martin Landau (as a stepfather of Ed), who plays a cute role as an old man close to death which makes all the full of mind.
Jenna Elfman is good (but a little too emotional); her main problem is that she continues to be sucked in bad films, i.e.
I can't wait barely, and Krippendorf's tribe.
Woody Harrelson, as Ed, Ray, has his usual egg role, with his comic spirit (he wrote a book entitled "My brother upset on me.")
Elizabeth Hurley is perfectly interpreted as the easy slut, and Dennis Hopper, in a quick cameo as an Ed biological father, is a good choice (ironically after the role he refused as Christof in Truman's show).
Ellen Degeneres stood out as the executive which, after a certain time, decides that the spectacle should not go to the opposite of the opinion of Rob Reiner.
I hate comparing this film to The Truman Show, but the fact is that I was ashamed to see this film.
He thought I had gone from university to kindergarten after seeing Truman and Ed.
EDTV had neither real nor genius; it was Hollywood typical.
Extract the television part of the film, you have the simple intrigue: the man steals the girlfriend of the brother, his girlfriend leaves the city, the man obtains a new slutty girlfriend to have the impression of moving on, a slut breaks with him, the real girlfriend returns and voila, you have a romance.
I became so agitated during this film, I almost released.
The only reason it does not fall below a "C" note is due to fine support performance.
