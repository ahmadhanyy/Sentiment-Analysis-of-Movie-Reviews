It is a small stupid film that tries to be intelligent and sophisticated, but tries a little too strong.
With the voices of Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone, this computer-animated yak-fest (Think Toy Story [1996] filled with used merchanting) is one for Ant-Earters.
The main story is the independence of a worker named Z (Allen).
He wants more in life than simply digging underground for the colony.
When he discovers `` insectopia '', a mythical place where all insects can run freely, Z, as well as the princess of his colony (stone), travel in the world to find a meaning in life.
About 15 minutes after the start of the image, I started to wonder what was the interest of the film.
Halfway, I still didn't have an answer.
At the end of the credits, I just gave up and exhaust myself.
Antz is an insane mess of bad writing and even more poor voice.
Allen is not, while I would have guessed, if I had not seen it in the powerful and basic instinct, Stone cannot act, even in a cartoon.
This film is one for bugs: funny and extremely dull.
Hey, the life of a bug can have a good time to do Antz.
