What did Kevin Williamson?
While the Revival horror film stimulated by its _scream_ gave some decent entries in the genre --_ I_Know_what_you_Did_last_summer_, _Halloween: _H20_, and _Scream_2_ -It should be noted that Williamson himself had a hand in writing these films.
These efforts of Williamson without Williamson, including _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_, frightened right - insignificant, insulting _bad_.
Add to this list _urban_legend_, which takes a promising premise and makes it go through a predictable idios meat.
Williamson's influence on the scriptwriter Silvio Horta is clear in two key areas.
First of all, the opening sequence, like that of _Scream_, is a piece of prolonged set detailing the singular murder which rolls the proverbial ball.
This sequence, in which the college of Pendleton Coed Michelle Mancini (Natasha Gregson Wagner) is beheaded by driving, also reveals the other, obviously Williamson-Esque Touch: The Killer's Look.
Dressed in a large hooded parka, brandishing an ax, the killer looks more like than a temporary resemblance to the _i_hnow ..._ fisherman,
Without the hook.
One thing that Horta does not take to Williamson, however, is the intriguing premise.
Pendleton students are killed through urban legends - these contemporary pieces of "mythology" went from one person to another, from a group in a group, from year to year who thus become anchored in social conscience.
No matter if they are true or not, like the big story that Mikey of life cereals advertisements died of a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi (he did not do it).
Michelle, killed by the "killer who hides in the rear seat" of the tradition, is only the first to fall for the prey of an urban legend that has become reality; as the number of bodies increases, thePendleton student colleague, Natalie (Alicia Witt), not only suspects a link between murders, but also a personal link with her past.
The configuration is promising, but the story never takes off, largely due to Horta and the director, the aptly named Jamie Blanks, who draws around his homonym in terms of suspense and fear.
Too many potential shocks are false dependent on the explosive musical clues, and the film prosecution scenes are riddled with shots that _Scream_ tried to sucked, like damsels that howled well in dead ends when they should - and could.Get out through the front door.
But this is only the tip of the iceberg with regard to clichés; there is also the unwavering nasty confession, in which an artificial and too practical motif is revealed, not to mention the credit card opening the turn ofThe locked door, which is a cliché in a kind of film.
The attempts to humor banks and Horta (intentional) are also forged; the fact that the best gags are lazy and intestinal references to the other credits of Co-Stars Joshua Jackson and Rebecca Gayheart speaks volumes on the imagination of theirhumor.
Some laughs are also made when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed, but I do not know if some of the most hilarious things on this subject were supposed to be.
The filmmakers do not have much help from their talent on the screen.
I was far from being a fan of bland _i_hnow ..._
The starlet Jennifer loves Hewitt, but I would have it every day, the terribly stiff and non -charismatic Witt, whose incompetent emotion attempts have often encountered laughter; Witt has a pefect leaf in her leading man just as designedBy Pesense, Jared Leto.
_DAWSON'S_CREEK_ Star Jackson hides in its way in a glorified cameo; GAYHEART displays the whole depth and the range of, well, a spokesperson for Noxzema; and Robert Englund lends the film a little more than its pedigree Freddy Krueger inAs long as a folklore teacher.
Admittedly, the cast is hampered by their equipment.
Loretta Devine, who has done great work in films such as _waing_to_exhale_, is salt with the ridiculous role of a M security guard at the Grier campus.
The kind of recently resuscitated horror cannot count on the efforts than a man - namely Kevin Williamson - remains alive.
If other filmmakers continue to make a poor quality product such as _urban_legend_, the genre seeks to resume the way of the many victims of the slashers.
