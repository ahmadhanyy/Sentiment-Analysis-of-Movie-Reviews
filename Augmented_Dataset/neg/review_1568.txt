There is not much good in this film.
I cannot say about the game, the realization or the writing that would make you consider seeing this film.
So I'm going to put my good comment away, at least Joel Schuemacher (Batman & Robin) did not run it where it would be entitled "Technicolor City".
In fact, there is nothing colorful in this film, it is dark and depressing and depressing until the end of the end.
The intrigue tends to be interesting, but everything that goes by laughing at ridiculous things thrown in what could have been a fascinating film.
The plot is impossible to explain because of its fool, so I will simply touch the bare minimum.
John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in the bathtub of a cheap hotel, only to discover that he has forgotten everything.
John must find out who he is before "foreigners" (a. K. a.
The spirit erasering the extraterrestrials) find it and uses it for their own diabolical conspiracy.
During the film, interesting points are raised on human individuality and the existence of intrinsically evil people.
However, all these points are completely "erased" from your mind when you look at the actors fall into the terrible script.
As I mentioned earlier, just the atmosphere is just in this film.
The game is bland, and as there is practically no character development, no one seems to worry about it.
The special effects are a small budget and some even hilarious, a sign of a real "film B".
The management is poor and there is little continuity, not that you are constantly expecting it in a film that changes realities.
Finally, the script is weak and has no concept of reality and does not deserve to have the word "science" in science fiction.
If I did not have my point of view, I will say it more clearly: it is a bad film.
Hopefully Alex's next film "I Wish I was Tim Burton" Proyas is at least tolerable.
