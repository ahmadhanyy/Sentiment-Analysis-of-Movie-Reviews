For reasons of synchronization linked to babysitters, we recently went to a multiplex and have seen infiltrated blues.
I would give him half a star for the guts.
Anyone in a film this bad should have courage.
Later, I read a review of the Ny Times who said that Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid had become so dodus that they seemed to have buns in the show.
The script was the worst.
They had characters who spoke with fun accents in order to make you laugh.
They had a lot of "big" gags like two people trying to go to a door together and therefore shoulders against the door.
Turner and Quaid both continued to smile like some idiots in a television game.
The good news is that we were intelligent enough to vote with our feet and on the left.
Buy tickets and give them to your worst enemies.
Tell them that the show is super and smile a lot.
 * * * * = One of the few films of this year or any year.

Totally unbearable.
