Here is a concept - Jean -Claude Van Damme is killed in the first ten minutes of the film.
Now, if that is not enough to finally get you to see a Van Damme film, I don't know what it is.
Aside from the sarcasm, it is certainly a different way of starting a film, of course a few minutes later, we discover that the new deceased had a twin brother - so we are lucky, we see more of Jean -Claude.
Van Damme # 1 works for the Russian mafia in the United States and is killed by some of their agents.
Van Damme # 2 is a police officer in France who discovers that he had a twin brother whom he did not know after the death of France.
The remaining twin (the French cop) goes to the United States to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death.
Once there, he connects with the girlfriend of his deceased brother, played by Natasha Henstridge, and the two decided to find out who are the murderers.
Jean-Claude's acting capacities do not seem to be up to the usual dull standards in this film.
In other words, just in case you have missed sarcasm, his game is worse than normal.
Randomly, Natasha Henstridge is in this film, and she does what she did best in cash - she is naked.
Unfortunately, this is probably the highlight of the film.
She is actually a decent actress, but has not improved as much as I thought after the species.
It is the typical film of Van Damme, with Jean-Claude making a variety of trips from high-end martial arts on his opponents.
Nothing new here, and certainly nothing that we have not seen in all the other Van Damme films.
In other words, there is absolutely nothing new in this film.
He has a reconsidered intrigue - this is not the first time that Jean -Claude has played twins.
He still cannot act.
We have all seen the Natasha breasts in cash (although this is a repeated performance that I do not complain about).
It looks roughly like each film in which Van Damme has never been involved - sub -PAP.
