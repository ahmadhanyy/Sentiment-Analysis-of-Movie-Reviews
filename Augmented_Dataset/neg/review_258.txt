Revue de Susan Granger on "Ghosts of Mars" (Sony Pictures Entertainment)
The horror author John Carpenter ("Halloween", "Vampires") launches with this science fiction eco-fable which is so serious that it has the mind to imagine how the project has ever been green.
The Carpenter and Larry Sulkis script seems to have been removed directly from "Pitch Black" from last year, involving a violent prisoner who must be released from servitude so that he can help a small band of humans to protect themselves againstblood extraterrestrials and marauders.
In 2176, there were 640,000 Earthlings on Mars, living in a matriarchal company led by a commander, played by Pam Grier.
Grier, Pill -Poppin 'Natasha Henstridge and some Police Recruit Mars (Clea Duvall, Jason Statham) go to the mining city distant from Shining Canyon to recover "Desolation" Williams - It's Ice Cube - to bring it back to Chryse City toThe city of Chrysum in the city of Chrysus to the city of Chryse Being a trial for murder.
But when they are besieged by denied minors, like a zombie and scratching the body, they easily release the scubed ice cube because they need it to protect themselves.
It seems that a red cloud has been released from a brilliant canyon cave and, shortly after, most of the minors have become crazy because the long vestiges of an ancient Martian civilization took over their minds to claimTheir planet, "according to a scientist (Joanna Cassidy).
Carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the story "Night of the Living Dead" that the silly intrigue becomes incomprehensible confusing.
But you can easily predict each of the support characters who will be killed, as well as the order of their elimination.
On Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "Ghosts of Mars" accumulates to a laboratory, at the bottom of a barrel 1.
Perhaps, indeed, there is a curse on the movies of March, if you remember two other failures: "Mission to Mars" and "Red Planet".
