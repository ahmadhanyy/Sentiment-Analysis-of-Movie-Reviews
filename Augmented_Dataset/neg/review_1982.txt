Dude, it was a weird film.
Similar to conspiracy theory in that it could not decide what kind it is.
The first hour is the clone of standard extraterrestrials, which has created a strange atmosphere on the ship.
The last half hour?
It was then that the manufacturers blew up the script in the SAS and just decided - "see, let's kill everyone".
From then on - forget science fiction ... this
The film becomes 100% horror.
What really disappointed me in this film was that he tried to scare you entirely in the wrong direction.
Instead of using intelligent tips or trying to accumulate for fear - this film simply uses strong noises, sudden camera shifts and short gore shards ..... Based .... everythingthe world
Iâ€™ve all seen all of this and know how to expect it.
The only thing that was well done was the advance to discover what happened to the previous crew.
There are skeletons hanging around and puree, but what is it?
Then finally after being painfully restored - the new crew considers the video.
The game is not too bad at all ..... Given what the actors had to work, because there is no complex or interesting dialogue to say.
However, there was a very beautiful camera work in certain sequences, such as when the shell near the event bridge of the event is raped and the camera reproduces to follow specific objects while they bounce on the bridgeand are sucked in space.
This film could have been so much better.
There was a good experienced distribution that deserved more to work.
There was nothing new here that one of us had not seen before in extraterrestrials or Hellraiser.
