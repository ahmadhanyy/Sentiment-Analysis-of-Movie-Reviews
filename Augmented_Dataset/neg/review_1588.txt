This is the worst film that I have seen so far in 98.
The Avengers = Idi = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers> scientists bad dressed in teddy bear costumes + a greater evil, sir August de Wyter carrying kilt.
The question is what could have been wrong with a potential ideal with a big name?
The same question was probably asked last year Batman and Robin.
I think that production has become a little too sufficient, the script a little for intelligent and direction was lost in a way in the chaos of random events that entered together to form a film.
My biggest criticism is based on the fact that there was no chemistry between Emma Peel and John Steed (Thurman and Fiennes)? Something that was a vital element of the television series of the 60s of the same name.
The dialogue continues indefinitely on tea and other finer British advantages, but does not allow much room for the development and interaction of the characters, except to perhaps grate the nerves of the spectator.
One wonders why the dynamic pair cares about kissing at the end with the exception of pure English formality.
Connery as Sir August, does not do better than Thurman or Fiennes.
His dialogue is as erratic as stormy time, mainly embarrassing and of poor quality.
If there is a film that you would prefer never to see, I believe that the Avengers would be a good choice.
On the one hand, you will not have to attend a product much lower than the three high -level names associated with the title.
I cannot understand how something so badly produced could have been released, but I put it on one of these bizarre events in nature, like lightning that you cannot see it coming to thatLet it hit you.
