I was looking forward to seeing this film since I heard about it at the beginning of last year, when Matthew Perry had just signed.
I am a big fan of the sense of subtle humor of Perry, and in addition, I think that the extreme game on board Chris Farley was a riot.
So, of course, when the trailer for "almost Heroes" hit theaters, I almost jumped from top to bottom.
A soda in hand, the lights that decrease, I was ready to be blown away by the last main role of Farley and what was supposed to be the great breakthrough of Matthew Perry.
I was ready to be just surprised; so that it is among the best in Farley, despite the absence of David Spade.
I was ready to laugh my head by the minute when the credits worked.
Unfortunately, none of this has happened.
The humor is at best unequal, with good times and laughable liners shortly.
Perry and Farley have no chemistry; the role in which Perry was played obviously seems to be written for Spade, because it is his type of humor, and not at all what Perry is associated.
And the film tries to be intelligent, a subject better left alone when it is a Farley film.
The film is a major disappointment, with only a few scenes that are worth a first look, not to mention a second.
Perry does not deliver a humorous line the whole film, and not surprisingly; the only reason why the film made the opening week of the first ten lists on the list is because it was announced with Farley.
And Farley's classic humor is also widespread.
Almost Heroes works almost, but missing the car train with a fairly long.
The guys, let the exploration in Lewis and Clark, huh?
Stand "Tommy Boy", and we will all be "friends".
