When the film presents Richard Lynch in the role of villain in chief, you know that you can not expect anything more than action film B grade.
However, since this film also featured Michael Madsen, more than the actor of a capable character, this time in the role of protagonist, the author of this criticism decided to give the film an advantage of doubt.
However, the very first scenes show references of action Clear B grade - Madsen embodies Richard Montana, a hard policeman who poses a drug warehouse and makes life miserable for the Lord of Local Crime Mario Gio (played by Lynch).
However, the raid only partially succeeded and Montana obtains rap.
Thus, he began his own private war against Gio, trying to penetrate his organization by pretending to be corrupt.
In the process, he meets Gio's mistress, Gina Zamora (played by Rosie Vela) and also begins a relationship with her.
Although this does not stink like many similar films, the inner edge is mainly a forgetful B quality r routine.
No one in this film makes a lot of efforts, including Madsen or Lynch, and this is particularly the case with the uninspired screenwriter William Tannen or the director Warren Clarke.
The only not so forgettable element of this film is the presence of the old model Rosie Vela, who, in addition to showing him more than impressive looks, also shows some of the singing talents.
However, this is not a sufficient reason for viewers to spend an hour and half watching a film that they, according to most of the chances, would forget the next day.
