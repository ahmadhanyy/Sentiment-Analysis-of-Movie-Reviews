Louie is a speechless trumpener.
In order to court her lady Love Serina, Louie became friends with a young boy, Sammy, who persuades Professor Mme.hammerbottom (Carol Burnett) allow Louie to attend the class.
Louie learns to read and write and returns to her herd, but makes fun of again when no other swan can understand her love message for Serina.
To worsen things, Louie's father feels that he lost her honor because of the trumpet he stole for his son in this animated version of E.
White's "swan trumpet".
As Jane Austen and Henry James have become popular sources for adult filmmakers in the last decade, E.NE
White has returned for children's movies.
The animation "Charlotte's Web" has become a classic minor since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us a live version of "Stuart Little".
 "Trumpet of the Swan", directed by Richard Rich (Lâ€™Animination de 1999 "The King and I", the series "Swan Princess"), is unlikely to remember these two.
 "Trumpet of the Swan" receives a regional theatrical version, but it is sure to appear quickly on domestic video.
Boston is one of the targeted cities because our hero Louie becomes famous by playing his trumpet in Beantown.
He meets a Gitan type crook in public gardens who launches Louie and her trumpet as an additional attraction for Boston swan boats.
Louie remains at Ritz Carlton before giving a concert to the hatch shell along the banks of the Charles river.
At this point, Louie has earned enough money for Dad to pay the trumpet and become fairly musically capable of winning Serina's father.
 "Trumpet of the Swan" presents a flat -bottomed art, bad synchronization of sound and insipid and sweet songs.
This effort would be better suited to Saturday morning television than the big screen, but maybe OK for the real little set.
