Susan Granger's review on "The Watcher" (Universal)
Just what we need: another saga of lurid and trash serial killer.
This time, Keanu Reeves plays an elusive homicide maniac which engages in a horrible match of cat and mouse with James Spader, an agent of the burned FBI who underwent a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years at work with the with theWith work with it with it with the work with the work with it with it with it with the with the with the with lalapd.
To taunt Spader, who moved to Chicago, Reeves packs his faithful piano thread and also moves.
Before a long time, he begins to send photographs of young lonely women and without distrust which are his victims of the windy city, contesting Spader, as well as the Chicago police service, to arrest it within 24 hours before embarking onnew.
In the midst of this deadly frenzy, there is Spader's psychologist, played by Marisa Tomei, who is even less convincing as a health professional than Jennifer Lopez in "The Cell".
The writers David Elliot, Clay Ayers and Darcy Meyers, as well as the director for the first time Joe Charbanic (clips helmet for the group of Reeves, Dogstar), dwell on the distorted thrill of methodology and prosecution, revealingAt first, exactly what the killer says that he and the cop "need each other to give meaning to our lives".
In addition, as Reeves explains, "we are all stacked on each other, but we no longer notice ourselves."
After that, these are all sound effects and delicate camera work, as well as a confusing and discordant soundtrack.
The actor technique of James Spader can be described as "impassive wooden" while Keanu Reeves maintains his character "guy" perpetually monotonous who sometimes works, sometimes not.
Chris Ellis, as a colleague from SPADER, is the only actor who manages to be convincing.
On Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "The Watcher" is a terribly horrible amateur 2. The real torture is to look at it.
