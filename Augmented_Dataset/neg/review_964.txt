Staring, George Clooney, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chris O'Donnell and Uma Thurman with Alicia Silverstone.
Well, to start, I would just like to say a few things.
First of all, I miss Michael Keaton, I miss Tim Burton and I prefer to think that these last two Batman films are all like a Dallas dream sequence.
Even of the first film was really that Batman was really the "star" although he was damn close to the first couple anyway.
In "Batman Forever" and now in "Batman & Robin", he is almost pushed to be a little player.
I can't really say if Clooney (who, despite everything, was better than Kilmer) was a very good Batman or not.
He has practically nothing to do, he could also have been there and that would not have made a lot of difference.
Now Joel Schumacher said he refused to comply with the masses who hated his films and applauded Buton's return that he will not make Batman Couvain and Dark.
Very well, I mean granted "Batman Returns" when being a great film was sometimes a little dark.
However, his brilliant neon style and Campy only kills all that this series meant for me.
I am generally very easy on movies.
I loved "Con Air" and other films that some criticisms have criticized.
Admittedly, this film was really thin, a clich√© mounted, except for one thing, it was fun.
There is practically no pleasure in this film.
I could not have worried less.
It will train the little ones because there is not really violence, no everyone is doing well at the end like these old television shows where it ends with everyone laughing.
Schwarzenegger is horrible, I mean really, really bad ...
And it comes from a regular fan of his work.
I love his films most of the time and the fundamental reason is that he never says much in any of them.
He often speaks in this film.
I would have preferred to have seen Patric Stewart in the roller.
I really believe like a film, you have to worry at least someone in a film.
I liked Alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap blow.
