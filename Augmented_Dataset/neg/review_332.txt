What are we going to do with Jim Carrey?
The television of "In Living Color" on television know this cartoon with a man of characters such as Fire Marshall Bill.
Viewers also know that "In Living Color" is a sketch show and that a little Jim Carrey goes very far.
Unfortunately, this fact was forgotten by the manufacturers of the AS of the Carrey Ventura comedy: Pet Detective.
Three writers, including Carrey, worked on the history of Slapstick, which sends a "pet detective" self -proclaimed on the track of a stolen dolphin.
The missing mammal belongs to the dolphins of Miami, who need their mascot for the next superbowl.
For the porpoises of the plot, this story works as well as any short stooges.
Carrey manages to make his "official" schtick as he whips in the Grand Miami.
He gets up and sneered, entering his neck with a funny effect.
He even made his identity theft of Captain Kirk.
Again .
All this is quite harmless things until you realize that writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on someone * other * than Carrey.
 (Alternative title suggested - Jim Carrey: will make everything to laugh.)
Export it to France and you can have a blow.
In the current state of things, Ace Ventura is not even good kid's business.
The number of blasphemies alone is too high.
Which is ironic because children are probably the best audience in Carrey.
The film does not even have the charm of Goofball of the recent cabin boy in the mooring of Chris Elliott.
Of course, Carrey has his moments.
But what can you say about a film whose high points include watching Carrey slip on the theme of "Mission Impossible?"
Ace Ventura has a blatant incongruity.
In the middle of the jokes and double-tirs buttocks, the script takes great difficulty in setting up an elaborate and rather funny "crying game" gag.
And, for * this planned public, which takes (ahem) of cojones.
