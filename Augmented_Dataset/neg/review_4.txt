Bastard Happy's quick film review
Shit this bug y2k.
He is one step ahead in this film with Jamie Lee Curtis and another brother Baldwin (William this time) in a story concerning a team of trailers.
They do not know power inside ...
By going for the gore and bringing some action sequences here and there, the virus is always very empty, like a film that goes for the whole flash and no substance.
We do not know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere, we do not know the origin of what took control of the ship (just that a big pink thing struck the mir), and, wellSure, we don't know why Donald Sutherland drunk on all along.
Here, it's just "hey, hunt these people with robots".
The game is less than the average, even Curtis.
You are more likely to kick his work at Halloween H20.
Sutherland is wasted and Baldwin, well, he acts like a Baldwin, of course.
The real star here is the design of Stan Winston's robot, some Schnazzy CGI, and the good occasional gore gore, like picking in someone's brain.
So if the robots and the parts of the body really activate you, here is your film.
Otherwise, it is roughly a ship flowing from a film.
