Documentary "Doom and Dherm" unilateral on the possible annihilation of the human race as predicted by the Bible.
Orson Welles tells and appears in the film in which he, with the successful author Hal Lindsey, discusses various prophecies of the Bible and tells them to recent events (well for 1976 anyway).
The film is very dated, like many things that are supposed to happen in the "future" never.
For example, the planets of the solar system had to line up in 1982 and cause chaos here on earth.
We are always here.
The arms race between the Soviets and America was supposed to launch the apocalypse.
We are always here.
Some of the most ridiculous moments occur when it is alluded to people like Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger can actually be the Antichrist (!).
In addition, ten minutes ago of stock sequences at the end of the film intended to give us an idea of what the battle for Armageddon could look like.
If it is something as it is represented as here, it will be incredibly boring.
The deceased large planet Earth is available on DVD from VCI Home Video.
It contains the film in standard form (appearance report of 1. 33: 1), although certain moments of stock sequences are in mailbox.
Biographies on Orson Welles and Hal Lindsey are also included, as well as a trailer for another recent video version of VCI Home, carts of the Gods.
Audio is Mono Dolby Digital, and the video is just good for a film like this.
I think this is the first appearance of this film on any domestic video format, so any condition suits me.
I certainly did not expect a remastered impression.
Curiously, the menu screens of this DVD are nothing like menu screens illustrated at the back of the case.
But these are menu screens ...
So who really cares?
