Supposedly based on a true story in which the British leads to building a rail bridge in the depths of Africa stopped after a pair of lions who began to kill the workers in 1898.
John Patterson (Val Kilmer), the expert in the construction of bridges to supervise the operation, tried to rid its functioning of the lions, but fails.
A global yield hunter, Remington (Michael Douglas) is called and the battle, the man against Lion, begins.
This film has a large soundtrack and wonderful landscapes.
The game is not too bad, except that the characters are all so thin.
We only see one side of each character.
Kilmer is a bridge manufacturer and that's all we see.
These lions kill dozens of his men and he does not even seem too upset about it.
What about the intrigue?
These are jaws, but with lions.
Again, we are presented with an animal that does not behave at all as it should be.
He seems to kill men because it also likes.
Why ?
who knows .
I assume that there would not be many history if it was not the case.
The problem is that there are not many history even if this is the case.
