I would like to be able to describe with precision the theme music of part 3.
The best way to say is that it's funky.
I know it's a strange question, but remember the opening music of "Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol", when Steve Guttenberg and Michael Winslow interpret the song title "Citizens on Patrol" during the credits ofopening?
It's like that.
Be that as it may, part 3 takes place one day after the events in part 2 (therefore technically still 1985).
This time, a group of excited adolescents (who also bring two aging hippie hen for any reason) head for a cabin on Crystal Lake for a weekend of sex and weeds.
It turns out that one of the teenagers had been attacked by Jason earlier in his life (which was to be between parts 1 and 2), so why she returned to Crystal Lake one day after a new batch of murders exceeds me.
She is the only survivor this time.
Part 3 was initially shown in 3D rooms, and from what I can say about video, it seems that they could have been quite decent effects.
Jason had long and wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2. Mainz, a day later, he is completely bald.
In addition, he is a day later, he can't be Friday 13, can he now?
too bad .
Steve Miner is the only director to have run more than one film in the series.
