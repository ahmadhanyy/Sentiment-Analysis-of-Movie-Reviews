A dragon 18 feet high and 43 feet long is the computer-generated co-star of this strictly sword film among the 'n' sorcery numbers.
As expressed by Sean Connery, "Draco" is a surprisingly expressive creation that is well deserved from its 23 minutes of screen time.
He walks, speaks, flies, fries and even simulates his own death, all with the help of 96 computer -assisted animators.
Too bad it (industrial light and magic) cannot spare special effects for the co-stars of Dragonheart * Human *.
A bearded black hole exists where Dennis Quaid should be.

And the list continues .
 (I have to ask: does the screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue intend to that * each * character be stabbed, launched or cut at least once?
Keep this man away from the knife drawer!)
The last five minutes of this film are the worst, with stupid nonsense that would be laughed at any planetarium light show, even less a summer film.
