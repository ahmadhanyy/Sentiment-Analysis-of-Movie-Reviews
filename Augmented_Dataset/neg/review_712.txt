Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:
The strange couple II
Grumpy old men is not the case.
Hell, my American compatriots, this is not the case.
Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are joining forces again for an even more worn vehicle than any of their films in recent years.
The bizarre couple feel terribly generic, where in the first film, made thirty a year, looks like a wonderful story.
It's like reconditioning the campbell soup in generic food, really.
How the writer Neil Simon could have made a horrible error in the screen writing exceeds me.
Throughout the film, I really didn't laugh once.
honestly .
I mean, there were stupid situations, yes, like the cropduster who let these old Geezers have it without any notice, but they really did not seem funny.
And this rolling car from the cliff?
The only way I would have seen humor is if they were still there.
And the end becomes just as super mixed.
In the last twenty minutes, Lemmon meets a girl he thinks that he is, then loses her; Matthau speaks to his son (a wasted Jonathan Silverman) of his amr Horire to the daughter of Lemmon; and, of course, Lemmon andMatthau have another roommate in their hands.
Ooh, I really gave a lot there, I'm sure.
Consider it as a hospital gesture, you don't waste your time renting this mud.
