With Kiefer Sutherland; Reese Witherspoon & Bokeem Woodbine I thought that the conversation was the worst film I have ever seen.
The highway gives me a second thought.
The highway is a modern story of the small red riding hood.
It was only in the 90s, Little Red Riding Hood was a coarse juvenile offender played by Reese Witherspoon, and Big Bad Wolf is a serial killer (Keifer Sutherland).
To overcome this pathetic premise - Reese will visit Granny and you will never guess who is waiting under the blanket in the Granny bed.
Keifer Sutherland is one of the most talented and talented actors, and Reese Witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star.
So what are they doing in this film?
After seeing the final result, they undoubtedly ask themselves the same question.
You may be wondering why it is a short review.
The answer is quite simple - I no longer want to waste my time writing or thinking about this film than necessary.
I lost my time enough just sitting through.
Note in Keifer: You wonder why you are not a bigger star in Hollywood?
Because you continue to make films like this.
Note to Reese: You were great in fear, what happened this time?
Note both: Don't worry too much, no one saw this film anyway.
Conclusion - I always shake my head.
Do not waste your time on this turkey.
If you want to see a big Keifer Sutherland film, go and rent Flatliners or young guns.
The abundant talents of actor from Reese Witherspoon are used to their full potential in fear, a big thriller.
Make a favor and rent one of these films - but stay as far from the highway as possible.
