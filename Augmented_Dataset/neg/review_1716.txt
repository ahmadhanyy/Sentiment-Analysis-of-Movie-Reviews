Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi and Omar Eppps make a nice trio of protagonists, but they are roughly the only pleasant element of the MOD team, a large screen version with the TV show of the 70s.
The story has all the originality of a wooden block (well, this would be the case if you could decipher it), the characters are all empty slates, and the surface action sequences of Scott Silver are also clich√©that they come.
By pure force of talent, the three actors try the marginal pleasure of the procedure whenever they are on the screen, but the Squad mod is only a second -rate action of action with a first -rate casting.
