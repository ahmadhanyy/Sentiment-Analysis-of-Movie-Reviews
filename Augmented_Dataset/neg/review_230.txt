Bastard Happy's quick film review
holy man
More like sacred shit.
The film features Eddie Murphy as a mystical figure called G in a strange journey in a way when it meets two network frames (Jeff Goldblum and Kelly Preston) with a flat tire on their hands.
In one way or another, he finds himself in their car and on their channel, a range of infomerce programs featuring Betty White, Morgan Fairchild and a slew of other celebrities and nameless personalities.
It is here that he seems to hit his stride, speaking of life instead and in a way stimulating sales.
At this stage of the film, of course, morality comes into play, in particular on Goldblum, which suddenly feels that he can market the magic G in the megabucks to end with his boss (Robert Loggia).
It takes not long for the film to take place in Sappy Mush, with achievements that take place on the left and right and bad points of the plot.
Only a real zippy sequence involving the frying of Morgan Fairchild's face seems to have an interest in the film.
Murphy does not lend anything to his character and the poor Goldblum seems to be prefers to be elsewhere.
Some may say that the film has a message, but all that met me is that I could probably get more entertainment by looking at this informational with the guy in the question coat.
At least he has something to withdraw us ...
