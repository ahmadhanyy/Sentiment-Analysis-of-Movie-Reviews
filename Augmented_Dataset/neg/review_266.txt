"Showgirls" is the first big budget film with big studio to receive an NC-17 note.
And its release last year occurred at a time when Senator Bob Dole and other politicians reprimanded the entertainment industry for the promotion of sex and violence.
But if "Showgirls" is an indication of the future of Hollywood, Washington people should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to American values - the creation of films.
 "Showgirls" is a tireless look at the Strip of Las Vegas strip, and the film turns out to be just as trash as its subject.
Director Paul Verhoeven and the writer Joe Eszterhas, who collaborated on another shock value project, "Basic Instinct" from 1992, follow the fate of a young woman (television star for adolescents Elizabeth Berkley) determined atMake a name as a dancer with bare breasts.
It is a hackney premise to start, so unsurprisingly, all stock characters are transported by truck.
There is the demanding producer.
The faithful friend.
The competitor Garce.
For fear that I forget the owner of Scmy Club.
Of course, any attempt to develop the character or a coherent scenario is only the dressing of the windows for the main attraction of the film - an endless parade of frontal nudity.
Unfortunately, "Showgirls" is not satisfied in this department.
The direction of Verhoeven, the style of direction opposite, does not prove exciting or erotic.
To worsen things, you will be forced to sit down through the dressed scenes from the film, which do not dissipate for the laughable game and some of the most absurd dialogues ever spoken in the history of cinema.
Verhoeven and Ezsterhas deserve the merit of having tried to break through, but if it is an entertainment for adults you want, stay at home and look at the Playboy channel.
You will be the wisest for that.
