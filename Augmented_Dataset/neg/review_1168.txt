Susan Granger's review on "Two can game games" (Screen Gems)
Since the success of "Waiting to Exhale", there have been several romantic comedies on African-American professionals.
This fantasy of female revenge, Vivica A.Fox plays Shante Smith, a superb advertising executive that seems to have reached the pinnacle of success: a manor, a sports car and an idyllic relationship with a hot and hot lawyer, Morris Chestnut.
She is at a time of her life when she provides advice to her grateful friends (Mo'nique, Wendy Raquel Robinson, Tamala Jones).
 "When your man spoils, no matter how small he is", describes himself with sufficiency, "Yuh has to punish him."
So when she catches her hot man dancing in a bar with an intelligent and sexy rival, Gabrielle Union, she designs her own version of "The Rules", an emotionally punishing plan "10 days" to recover it.
Unfortunately, the writer / director Mark Brown ("How to Be a Player") breaks the cardinal rule of the romantic comedy: you must love the protagonist - and Shrill and self -felicitations shante Smith is a musagaine that underlines, superficial and ofVicedness that does not do. I realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love.
To make it speak directly of the camera becomes stingy very quickly and the system of title card "One day" "of the day" "underlines boredom.
The comic strip Anthony Anderson marks the best noisy friend of Chestnut, and the singer Bobby Brown makes a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who gave a gentle cure by ms.robinson.
But outings on fence credits contain more humor than the film itself.
On the GRANGER film gauge from 1 to 10, "Two can play game" is SMARMY Si Slick 4, filled with a misogynistic attitude and flagrant products (Coca-Cola, Miller Authentined Draft) but few more.
In this R-Rated (for an explicit sexual language), the Pseudo-Hanche Battle of the Sexes, the public loses.
