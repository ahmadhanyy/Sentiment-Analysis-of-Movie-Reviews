Longtime Buddies and the members of the tribute group of Neil Diamond Wayne (Steve Zahn, "Happy, Texas") and J.D. (Jack Black, "High Fidelity") Watch with horror the third companion Darren Silverman (Jason Biggs, "American Pie ") disappears under the thumb of his new fiancé Judith, (Amanda Peet," The Whole Nine Yards ") a controlling psychiatrist.
They are doubly troubled when the return of Darren 'One and Only Love' Sandy Perkins (Amanda Detmer, "Final Destination") returns to their hometown but does not cause undulation in the dedication of Darren to Judith.
There is only one thing Wayne and J.D. can think of doing - they kidnap Judith and simulates his death in "Saving Silverman".
Written by Hank Nelken and Greg Depaul after seeing a fiancé friend at the bad woman, "Saving Silverman" is directed by the "successor of successful comedy" Dennis Dugan of films such as "Big Daddy", "Brain Donors" and "Problem child ".
It is a dismal and third -order Farrelly brothers who try to milor from humor from pieces of fantasy as inspired as the fact that Darren's romantic interest comes from a family of circus monsters and to beabout to become a religious.
The coarse gags include a visualization of Darren obtaining cheeky implants.
 "Saving Silverman" is almost saved by the stars Zahn and Black.
These two are so comically talented that they can take bad equipment while delivering the goods.
They are in "Animal House" mode while the rest of the film makes a punishment and appears empty.
Jason Biggs can give his whole career to have been sunk in the hit Smash "American Pie".
Peet shows physical movements but no flair for the comedy here while Detmer slaps a courageous and sweet smile on his face and soldiers through.
R.Lee Ermey ("Full Metal Jacket") is a note of an embarrassing performance as an ex-football psychopathic coach.
Neil Diamond appears at the height of the film like him and miraculously animates the procedure by surrounding some of his old standards.
