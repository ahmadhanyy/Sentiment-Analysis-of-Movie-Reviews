Long and ugly are two words to describe the boring drama of the English patient.
The big game, music and cinematography were beautiful, but too many sub-work and dull characters made the film difficult to follow.
Ralph Fiennes (Strange Days, Schindler's list) gives a captivating performance as Count Laszlo Almasy, victim of amnesia and horrible burns after the Second World War in Italy.
The story revolves around its past, in the form of a flashback, which makes it even more confusing.
Anyway, he is collected by Hana (Juliette Binoche, the rider on the roof), a boring nurse torn by the war.
She has never been really transformed into anything, until she meets an Indian towards the end, developing another sub -intrigue.
Count Almasy begins to remember what happened to him as he is explained by a foreigner (Willem Dafoe, Basquiat).
His love (Kirstin Scott Thomas, Mission Impossible) was seriously injured in a plane crash and finally died in a cave.
He returned to find her dead and was broken by the heart.
He therefore stole his corpse somewhere, but was shot down from the ground.
Make no mistake, it may seem good and the trailer may be tempting, but is the last thing this film is.
Maybe if it was an hour less, it might be tolerable, but 2 hours and 40 minutes of conversation is too much to manage.
The only qualities of redemption of this film are the beautiful game of Fiennes and Dafoe and the magnificent cinematography of the desert.
Apart from these, the English patient is full of scenes with no value of boredom and wastes completely too many films.
