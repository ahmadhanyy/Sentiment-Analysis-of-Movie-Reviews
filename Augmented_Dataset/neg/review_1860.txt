Well, if you haven't seen when Harry met Sally where he said, she said, or if you don't watch Love & War on television, you might think it's the most inventive film toComing for ages.
However, if you saw one of these elements, you have seen most of this film.
Of course, that doesn't mean it's bad.
A game is fun, but overall, I just had to ask what it is for?
Arye Cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love.
Kevin Pollack is the best stereotypical friend who fears women who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes, most of which were not very funny.
COUTENEY COX is the stereotypical woman concerned with a career who falls in love.
Julie Brown is the best bizarre stereotypical friend of said woman.
 (Note the frequent use of the stereotypical word.
This film uses many formulas, the plot is mainly known to opening credits.)
So what's good in the film?
Well, as I said, there are a few fun moments.
Surprisingly, Julie Brown, whom I usually find simply clumsy, was the best thing in the film.
There are also several very funny sequences involving the analysis of the human mating ritual.
Gee, it's really short.
Not much to say about the film.
It's just a bit there.
Watching it on video may not be a full waste of time, but I would not recommend hiring a baby-sitter or spending a lot of money to see it in the theater.
