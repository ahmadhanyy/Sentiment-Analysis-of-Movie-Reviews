The former "American Pie" Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari Star in the attempt for this summer to capitalize on the youth market in search of a comedy on the young people to whom they can refer to a cute generic Hollywood couple and a comedycrazy.
It is an A + student (Biggs as a "Paul") who obtains a scholarship to a New York college which exceeds like a painful thumb and falls in love with Dora (SUVARI) a Goth of heroin chickAnd self-compliance with anything and allows yourself to be pushed just like "Hick-Boy" Paul.
So we have a fish water formula mixed with a romantic meeting comedy which should ideally make a good film.
Unfortunately, the atrocious scenario and the boring direction by the author "distraught" Amy Heckerling succeeds successfully on the film.
These characters are totally unrealistic and incredible - it's as if everyone under 30 was a raver lapid.
There is no background or detail to anyone or anything, it's just a bunch of cartoons from cartoons who collide with each other.
Not to mention the history itself which is practically nonexistent and contains so many dumplings that it is like Swiss cheese.
Even the basic edition is bad.
If you are looking for a romantic comedy, stay away from it because it is neither romantic nor funny.
I saw this in a cinema wrapped during the opening evening and the public barely laughed.
If you have seen the players, you have seen all the "funny" games (which are all the first five minutes).
