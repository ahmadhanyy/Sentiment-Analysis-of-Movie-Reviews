Broadwayâ€™s budding composer, Robert (Aaron Williams), secretly carries a torch for his best friend, the actor in difficulty Marc (Michael Shawn Lucas).
The problem is that Marc has only eyes for "perfect 10s", what Robert Geek and informative is certainly not.
Meanwhile, Marc's spoiled roommate (hetero), Cynthia (Mara Hobel), spends her days lying about their apartment and chief editor of Tina Brown magazine.
The "very romantic comedy" of director Victor Mignatti (as the advertising campaign indicates) is supposed to be (forgive the pun) an ol 'gay, but it is difficult to have fun with these boring and self-absorbed charactersAnd their surface area personal personal: Marc and Cynthia have domestic "crises" at the sitcom (like trying to kill bugs - how hilarious); Robert and Marc go to the actor class (how to riveter); zaftig cynthia continuesto eat ferges (how original).
But more than anything else, the three moans.
permanently .
Marc moans on his turbulent romance with an apparent "10", David (Hugh Panaro), the musician Hunky on the other side; Robert groans that he cannot find the right guy; Cynthia groans to have to find a job (horrors).
The terrible trio groans their way to a happy ending which is completely undesirable.
Add too wide performance and lapsy -labeled lipsynching by Panaro, and you end up with an amazing cinematographic damage.
