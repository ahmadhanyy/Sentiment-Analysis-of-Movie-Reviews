It is not a bad thing to update old stories.
It is done all the time in the oral tradition.
The difficulty with this film is not that the story has changed is that it is dry.
The new Cinderella, Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is not seated waiting for her prince to come.
She is a woman from the end of the 20th century, although located in the 16th century of France.
When her father dies, she stays in her house even if she is mistreated by her wicked mother-in-law Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston).
She works during the day, but reads Sir Thomas More by Firelight at night.
Although the story is updated, you know the plot.
Danielle meets Prince Henry (Dougray Scott), goes to a disguised bullet, is discovered later and they live happy forever.
The film is often like watching a filmed piece.
The theater in real life is captivating.
The theater on the screen is generally lifeless.
There does not seem to be many things.
The camera can be a movie star.
Here it is a co-conspirator.
Danielle's convictions are compromised.
Socialist and feminist, she claims to be a royalty to obtain her man.
A nice woman, her last act in the film is that of revenge.
The most pleasant characters are the most caricatured.
The generne fairy stand-in, Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) is fun to watch the eccentric old man who advises Danielle.
Huston is pleasant in his exaggerated wickedness.
In all honesty, my companion loved the film.
It is perhaps one of these "chick films" that men do not like.
It is certainly a date film.
Almost all the public was couples.
Well, it may be good for something.
