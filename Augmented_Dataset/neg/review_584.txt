The films can very well make the two great ES: educate and entertain.
In the best of all possible worlds, they perform both.
On the red planet, they fail entirely.
In the near future, an inhabited mission is sent to Mars to observe the primitive growth of plants.
This film does a remarkable job to demonstrate exactly how exciting the elongated algae would be.
After a few mumbo-jumbo on an ecological disaster on earth and an endless expectation to reach the fourth planet, the ship collapses almost as fast as the film.
The crew on the ground of people you do not care is trapped on the surface without food, water or air and tracked down by a deadly rogue cyberdog.
The only potentially interesting character (Carrie-Anne Moss) spends his time alone in the orbit ship to speak to a computer.
Trying to graft the mysticism of the "2001" space with the horror of the "Terminator" robot ", the first director Antony Hoffman does not seem to understand what is happening.
We can't either.
Had he had no one who could withdraw from the shooting and make sure that there was a coherent story?
Could it not have been able to use the money saved by having only to pay half a dozen actors to hire a screenwriter?
There is so much trouble.
Each opportunity to create a dynamic tension is thwarted by the route holes and the dull direction.
Why present the theme of the faith vs.Science if the crew which could comment it disappears early to die _offscreen_?
The public starts the film while waiting for something to happen.
Two hours later, they are still waiting.
Despite our greatest hopes, there is no life on the red planet.
