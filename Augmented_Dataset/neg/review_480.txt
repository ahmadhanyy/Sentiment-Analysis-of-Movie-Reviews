Susan Granger review on "Mulholland Drive" (Universal Focus)
Whatever David Lynch sells, I don't buy.
From the writer / director of "Blue Velvet" and "Twin Peaks" comes another dark and mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on Mulholland Drive, rue Serpentine which turns high in the hills of Hollywood.
Dazed, a beautiful brunette (Laura Elena Harring) emerges and stumbles on a hill, slippery not observed in a 30s style apartment while the tenant leaves for a trip.
The next morning, a pink blonde (Naomi Watts) by Deep River, Ontario, arrives in Los Angeles with celebrity dreams in his suitcase.
His aunt has the apartment and the two women meet.
The brunette has amnesia, so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity with her latent lesbian lust.
Meanwhile, a director of Hotshot (Justin Theroux), whose woman is in bed with the Poolman, is forced to throw a certain actress in her new film and there is an assassin (Mark Pellegrino) wandering in the city.
The tortuous paths of these different characters - and others named Cookie, Coco and Cowboy - meet at various points, but the plot remains elusive because, through history, Lynch a brunette and the blonde play two womenDifferent in an alternative reality, leaving an enormous bundle of species, a blue metal key, a paralyzed magnate and many questions that remain unanswered.
Elena Harring and in particular Naomi Watts are gifted actresses, making the subtle switch effectively.
The same cannot be said for the old M.G .M.
The dancer Ann Miller who is steep and self -aware, speaking - like most Lynch players - in Staccato tones.
On the Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "Mulholland Drive" is a frenzy, frustrating 4. Originally like an episodic television pilot, this surrealist style of suspense style on the substance is packed like a puzzle withSeveral of the key parts left side.
