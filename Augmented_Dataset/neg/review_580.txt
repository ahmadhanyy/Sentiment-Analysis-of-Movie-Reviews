I heard him call "Jaws With Claws" and it is a fair summation of the plot, although this slogan is not doing much to quantify the quality.
Director Stephen Hopkins (Blown Away, Predator 2) and screenwriter William Goldman (Maverick, Misery) would make it believe that it is an epic historical drama on man against nature, on the basis of what'really went to Africa to railway agents trying to build apont around the 20th century.

How about the three guys with rifles, trapping a lion and can't even hit the damned?
Or the game of ham on the lilies of Michael Douglas, who chews more landscapes than animals ??
Or, my favorite lions, so agile that they can even climb on the roofs?!?
