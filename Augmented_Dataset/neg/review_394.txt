Susan Granger review on "America's Sweethearts" (Columbia / Sony)
What a waste of a talented cast!
Billy Crystal and Co-Scenarist Peter Tolan have concocted a sly and provocative premise and, as an opening roll, it is obvious that they are trying an old-fashioned romantic comedy.
History implies a veteran publicist (Billy Crystal) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in Las Vegas when an arrogant director (Christopher Walken) holds a Megabuck film hostage in his editing room, refusing to show it to N'anyone.
He believes that by giving journalists juicy advice of a possible reconciliation between the formerly married stars of the film, but climbing, Gwen and Eddie (Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack), they will be so distracted that they will be"I remember that they did not see the film or that was not what they expected.
 (And Crystal thought of that long before a Sony executive concocted the false criticism of critic / David Manning!)
To get help, he turns to the assistant / personal sister of Gwen (Julia Roberts).
But laughter is rare.
Crystal Glib, Cynical Flack is not funny enough with a few fun liners.
After six months in the custody of a Guru of Depak Chopra (Alan Arkin), the character of Cusack is too fragile emotionally, devoid of the necessary charism.
The narcissistic diva of Zeta-Jones is not developed and unidimensional.
Only Hank Azaria, as a very macho Spanish love of Zeta-Jones, and Stanley Tucci, as director of the studio, and Roberts manage to concoct any eccentric foam.
Basically, we do not like these stereotypical characters focused on the ego, and even less rooted for them to relax their romantic tangibles, and the management of Joe Roth is predictable, formula and telegraph.
On the Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "America's Sweethearts" is a survey, shallow 4. As a covered satire, it is strictly superficial.
