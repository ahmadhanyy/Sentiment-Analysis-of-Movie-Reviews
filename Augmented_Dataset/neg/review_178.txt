The first film produced by the production company Happy Madison by Adam Sandler (intelligent title huh?) Is essentially a film of joke, a bit like the films that Sandler plays in itself.
However, the difference here is that this only joke is simply not very funny.
Rob Schneider embodies the title of title, a scrubbed fishing cleaner who ends up becoming a "man-man" to collect enough money to replace the tailor-made fish naughty from a rich client that Deuce has destroyed everythingBy staying at home.
Deuce continues many "dates", and each woman with whom he comes out has a "humorous" quirk on herself.
One has narcolepsy, one has Tourette syndrome, one is a man ...
etc., etc .
My problem is that we see all these women in the film's trailer, so why should I watch the film?
Given the trailer ...
Given the film.
Only a quick cam√©e from Norm Macdonald (and a follow -up joke during closing credits) generates laughter.
Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo is available on DVD from Touchstone Home Video (a Di $ Ney division).
The disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect report of 1.85: 1, and presents the original theatrical trailer (as well as the trailers of Mystery Alaska, Happy Texas and outside of Providence), a featuretteextremely brief production (which contains images not used in the film) and scenes storyboard comparisons.
Yes, you read correctly...
There are storyboard comparisons on this DVD.
Two scenes are storyboard ...
Neither is particularly exciting.
There are combat scenes in this film, so why don't we see storyboards of these segments (especially moments of parody of the matrix)?
I wonder what is funny: the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that Di $ Ney thought that fans of this film would like to see them?
Scenes deleted?
Of course .
Audio comment?
You Betcha.
But storyboards?
Go on .
