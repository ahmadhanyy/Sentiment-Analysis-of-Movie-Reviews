Capsule: Liebes meets tod.
It was a film on sex and death.
A morgue attendant accidentally revives a woman who died by a necrophilia and brings her into her world which is heavy with orgies.
This film says something obscure on the relationship between sex and death, but gives no idea.
To worsen the material, this impression was poorly subtitled in English from French.
0 (-4 to +4)
- An 18 -year -old attractive dies on a disco floor and is sent to a morgue.
One of the attendants, Ben (Jean-Marc Barr) is so attracted to her that he tries to necrophilia.
We see him crawling after a shock.
In the middle of sex, the dead adolescent returned to life.
- The morgue attendant only added a new form of sex to its collection of folds.
He was already part of a group that meets for sex S / M.
The rekindled teenager, Teresa (Elodie Bouchez) joins them.
- Moral dilemma of Teresa's father.
Ben abused his daughter's body, but in doing so, he saved her life.
- Part of this opaque allegory is a man saved from suicide who joins the sex hijinx.
A man is also involved in the last stages of Dying of Aids, a friend close to the morgue attendant.
It is not involved in orgies.
-The subtitles of our impression were white, often on a white background, often making them difficult to read, but I do not think there is a lot of meaning there which was lost.
- The title means "don't let me die on a Sunday."
