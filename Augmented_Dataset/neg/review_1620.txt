Die Hard 2 is a completely unhappy fiasco, less than the original in all respects.
Place the blame outright on Steven's shoulders from Souza and Doug Richardson, who wrote the pathetic script for the film.
Each line of dialogue starts either from the sap co -binding or forced humor.
The intrigue is completely improbable; the convoluted story implies a band of terrorists who take control of Dulles airport and have closed the control tower, leaving a dozen planes blocked in the air while waiting forto land.
The film has no credibility, and all the characters present themselves as clich√© cardboard cuts.
So much for the script.
And the action?
Well, let's say it this way: director Renny Harlin could learn some things from John McTiernan, who directed the original, as well as the Red October and Predator - all the stars for their breathtaking suspense.
On the other hand, Harlin has no clue in terms of choreography, and therefore Die Hard 2 never takes vapor.
Die more is impossible to take seriously, even for a minute.
In fact, the film often seems deliberately camping, and it almost reaches the threshold to be so bad that it is good.
You laugh, but you laugh at the movie, not with it.
Die Hard 2 should never have been allowed for takeoff.
