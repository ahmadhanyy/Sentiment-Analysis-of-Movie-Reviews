Terrence Malick made an excellent 90 -minute cinematographic adaptation of James Jones's novel in the Second World War.
Unfortunately, he buried it in a pseudo-epic of 3 hours.
It's a shame because the film has an exceptional performance by Nick Nolte.
The best scene is when the character of Nick Nolte, lt.col.tall, is forced to face the direct refusal by Captain.Staros (Elias Koteas) to execute an order.
Nolte's reaction and transformation can be the best job of her career.
If Terrence Malick focused on the great performances of Nolte and Koteas as well as those of Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson and John Cusack, he could have made a really great film.
Instead, Malick salted the film with a grumbling rhythm, unnecessary flashbacks and a narration of voice -over designed to telegraph the great philosophical foundations of history.
The narration was particularly boring, because a large part looked like a very bad poetry of the school.
With a lot of editing, the basic story could be transformed into a truly classic war film.
Hopefully the DVD version of this film will present options to remove the narration, and can even provide an alternative and shorter version of the film.
I give this film.
