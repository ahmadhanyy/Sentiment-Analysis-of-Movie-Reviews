Susan Granger review on "American Outlaws" (Warner Bros.)
"The Great Train Robbery" by Thomas Edison (1903) was the first western never made and "Jesse James under the black flag" (1923) presented the folk hero Outlaw.
Now, more than 20 images on the similar theme later, Jesse James and his famous Hors-La-Loi gang are traveling again in a banal MTV tour on an American legend.
The story begins like Jesse (Charasmatic Colin Farrell) and his brother Frank (Gabriel Macht), Cole and Scott Younger (Scott Caan, Will McCormack) and Faithful Comanche Tom (Nathaniel Arcand), after four years of struggle for rebs in theCivil Civilguerre, return to Liberty, Missouri - to discover that the troops of the Union occupy their hometown.
And a baron of the railway on the east coast, Thaddeus Rains (Harris Yulin), forces farmers to sell their land at a value less than truecurity.
But when my James (Kathy Bates) becomes one of their victims, Jesse and the rest of the guys (Gregory Smith, Ty O'Neal, Joe Stevens) form the gang of James-Younger to take revenge by attacking the lines of supplyRailway, sabotants to and steal the banks where the payroll is preserved.
In addition, there is romance - between Jesse and a hometown, Lee Mimms (Ali Larter).
Working from a politically correct clich√©? -Denchet, scripted and disinfected and revisionist by Roderick Taylor and John Rodgers, the director MAYFIEL maintains the rapid action and opts for light laughs when he can.
The agitated editing hurts, but the cinematography of Russell Boyd, the failures of the designer of Luke Reichle and the music of Trevor Rabin confer authenticity.
On Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "American Outlaws" is a rampant formula 3.
It is the Wild West revisited as a date film.
