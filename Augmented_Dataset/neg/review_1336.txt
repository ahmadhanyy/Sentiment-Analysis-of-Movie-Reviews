"The red violin" is a cold and sterile characteristic which leaves you not involved and detached.
It is a film that seems almost clinical, because it traces the story of more than 300 years from the legendary title instrument of the title.
Opening in the 17th century, history shows how the violin Nicolo Bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son.
But when the tragedy strikes, the violin becomes the personification of the sorrow of its creator.
From there, the violin enters the hands of an orphan prodigy child in an Austrian monastery.
Again, the tragedy strikes while the child is struck at the time of his triumph.
We follow the violin over the centuries because he finds a house in England and Mao Communist China before being discovered by expert Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson), who puts a meticulous investigation to prove his authenticity.
The violin becomes the obsession of Morritz, just like for all those who converge in an auction in Montreal to bid.
Morritz, however, is the only one to know the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate the intention of its creator.
 "The Red Violin" could have been a touching and inspiring story, as well as a symphony by Beethoven.
However, director Fran√ßois Girard makes no emotional link with the spectator.
Here is a story that could have used various camera angles and lighting to increase its impact.
Girard, for an unknown reason, mainly uses masters, keeping his camera - and therefore we - remotely.
We have no idea of the miracle which is the violin.
It is the resonance, its purity of the sound is not sufficiently underlined to make an impression.
None of the performance is not memorable either.
It is as if Girard wanted all his actors to play the second violin of his violin.
 "The red violin" promises a lot, but little offers.
It is sometimes dull, a little pretentious and troubled power.
The music of the film rises on its story and its artists.
And it is his only saving grace.
