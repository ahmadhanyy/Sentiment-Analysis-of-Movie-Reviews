"It was not scary."
These are the first words that came to my mind after the end.
When a film is called _vampires_, "not frightening" are not words that should be associated with it.
But it was not my only reproach.
John Carpenter is a name associated with advanced cinema, as in the intense fears of _Halloween_, _The thing_ and _ The Prince of Darkness_, or the quirky action of _ethey Live_ and _escape from New York_.
Unfortunately, the only thing that is at the forefront of _vampires_ is the level of boredom that the film is able to reach.
With an anemic route and special effects not quite Kosher, the vampires of _john Carpenter have barely sufficient substance to develop the thirst of the least demanding genre fan.
The film is first interested in a group of itinerant vampire killers, led by James Woods, of all people.
Like a sort of a holy team (they even have their own swollen van), the group invades and erases a nest of vampires in a new-mexic hut.
Their method is fun: blood suckers are wrapped by harpoons so that they can transform in the sun like matches.
To commemorate their victory, the Loutish group decorates a motel room with prostitutes and parties all night.
Their celebration is, however, short -lived as a vampire master named Valek ambushed and alone destroys most of the team.
Jack Crow and Buddy Montoya of Woods (Daniel Baldwin) escape from their lives, as well as a woman named Katrina (Sheryl Lee).
Although the woman was bitten, Montoya and Crow decide to keep Katrina for her psychic link with the Vampire Master.
The rest of the film is interested in boys hunting for Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), a bizarre guy by Marilyn Manson who is on a mission that dates back 600 years.
Along the way, they collect a priest named Guiteau (Tim Guinee), a character who serves almost the same goal as the Jittery CPL.
Upham in _ private saving Ryan_.
Some things occur in the middle of the film, but I do not remember most, because I have often found contractive hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on the screen.
_vampires_ finally begins to take about 90 minutes in the mixture, because Crow, Guiteau and Montoya attack a nest of vampire back in abandoned prison.
It is only then that the film even begins to look like a carpenter film.
But it is too little too late.
We get the inevitable final confrontation, but it seems nailed and rather anti-climatic (come on, we are dealing with _La_ Master Vampire here!)
Interestingly, the vampire actuator last summer _blade_ was derived from a comic strip, and _vampires_ of a novel, but the second seems more imbued with camping cheese than the first, a more superhero filmdeliberate.
Jack Crow by Woods overflows from the casual liners and moves away from the buildings that explode with this stride Oh-so Refrot.
And his reason to kill vampires?
Make a wild assumption.
 (Index: a ______ killed his _____ when he was only _____.))
At least _blade_ had a decent action and smooth elegance.
_vampires_ even lacking strong sensations to hide his slim gossamer intrigue.
To compensate for this, the film uses other "shocks", such as its generally condescending attitude towards women (Crow slaps them for pleasure) and a contempt too played for religion (Crow teases with constantly whether his wish toDele celibacy made her inclined to "get Woodies".)
We can say that I may want this film too much.
If it is not frightening and bloody, I wanted to tend, relentless and exhausting.
_John Carpenter's vampires_ is nothing of these.
I can only recommend it for the Hardcore carpenter fan.
For the rest of you looking for a good fear, beware: _vampires_ is a teeth-free film.
