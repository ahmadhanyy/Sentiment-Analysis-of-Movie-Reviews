What happens when you put Martin Lawrence in a big suit in real life?
You get Martin Lawrence in a coma (the actor thought he was growing, so he put many layers of heavy clothes and jogging at 100 degrees, finding himself in a coma).
So what happens when you put Martin Lawrence in a big costume in the movies?
You get an audience in a coma.
In the house of Big Mimom, Lawrence plays an agent of the FBI who is a master of disguises.
When a bad and naughty man escapes from prison and is looking for his former girlfriend (the very sexy nia long ...
The only thing that is worth watching in this film), she fled in Georgia to stay with her southern aunt of "Southern Big" (Ella Mitchell).
The FBI follows it to recover the large sum of money stolen from the flight of the bank that sent the rascal to prison.
However, the great mother is called in an emergency.
Feeling that they could lose their only chance of capturing the criminal, Lawrence is under cover as a great mother.
And let the comedy start!
Big Mommom's house is the definition of a "gadget" film if there was one.
The plot can mainly be summed up as "Martin Lawrence dresses in big woman" ...
And even this description is too verbose.
You can just see this script drawn on a table of table with Martin Lawrence / Fat Woman in the middle of the board with a large circle around him, and all kinds of clichs? D, "humorous" situations the pointe.
The big woman is playing basketball!
The big woman takes a dumping ground!
Big woman kung fu!
Well, they left an out of the table ...
The film critic slips into a coma!
Paul Giamatti (intimate parties, the negotiator) plays the partner of Lawrence and as much as I like his work, even he cannot inject life to this lifeless comedy.
Hell, the greatest artists on the planet could not operate this material ...
It's just as horrible.
