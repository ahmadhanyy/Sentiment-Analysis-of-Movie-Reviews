Plot: By realizing that they fail all their classes, two roommates try to find a third roommate who will kill themselves, because the school charter automatically grants the best grades to roommates of any pupil who succeeds in suicide.
Critality: Despite the interesting premise of this film and the dark subject, this film is zero because it is funny, boring, and presents us one of the worst acts of actor of Tom Everett Scott.
Add this to a completely unsuccessful romantic element, many gear and cheesy jokes, a long wait for the configuration and an end that eliminates all the darkness of this "black comedy" (if you are going to create a black comedy, don 't chicken inThe end of very bad things (8/10) for a perfect example), and you have a banal MTV creation worthy of its own subject.
I barely laughed at all the gags, I found the element of bong artificial and repetitive, and I was horrified not to find a free nudity thrown anywhere in this film (if you are going to doA bad university comedy, at least slap in free shooting for the children:).
This is not even worth the rental, guys.
Jump absolutely!
