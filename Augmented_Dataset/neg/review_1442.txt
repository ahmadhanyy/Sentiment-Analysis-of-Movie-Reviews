The fast shooting formula that worked so well by plane!, "Police squad!"
TV series, top secret!, Three naked pistol films and two hot strokes!
The films finally reached a desperate dead end with Spy Hard.
Even the silence of the hams of Ezio Gregio is undoubtedly more funny than this parody of spy and too extensive action.
Leslie Nielsen embodies the secret WD-40 agent, who returns from his retirement to fight her former enemy, General Rancor (a Caquetage Andy Griffith).
The jokes fly in all directions and barely a hint of restraint, timing or tact.
Most of the film includes recycled aircraft and naked barrel gags, sequences of recreated films and soggy star came off.
Yeah, maybe we need * need * from Ray Charles to drive an L. A .bus to a slowdown, but made Mr..T, Hulk Hogan and Dr.joyce Brothers must also appear in the same film?
Leslie Nielsen plays directly with her usual Flair Dopey.
There is something strangely inspiring in Nielsen's view of the habit of a nun, even the parody of the resulting sister act is silly.
Just like the bits directly raised from the house alone, from fiction to dough, real lies, etc. andc. (Teenagers could enjoy this mess, Tho.
The shots, breast works, penis pokes, flatulence gags and related innuendos are completely in the Beavis and Butthead alley.)
Beyond the hilarious title sequence with "Weird" Al Yankovich interpreting the theme song, Spy Hard is barely the stock on which it is printed.
My recommendation: I immerse you while you are waiting for another film to start.
Stay long enough to see the camera slip inside the Weird Al's nostril, then leave.
You will not miss anything.
