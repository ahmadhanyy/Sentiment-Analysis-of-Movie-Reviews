Synopsis: When a meteorite takes place in the Arizona desert, community college teachers Ira Kane (Duchovny) and Harry Block (Jones) are the first on the stage.
They discover that an extraterrestrial life form was born from the rock and evolves at an incredible pace.
Soon, the army, advised by Dr. Allison Reed (Moore), moves and force Kane and blocks.
But when the extraterrestrials begin to threaten society, it can take the combined efforts of scientists to stop them before putting an end to the evolution of another form of life: humanity.
Review: "Evolution" certainly has the ingredients of a decent comedy.
It is produced by Reitman, clearly trying to transform its success "Ghostbusters" in a 21st century counterpart.
He features Duchovny, and although we can question his judgment by pressing his "X-Files" character so shortly after leaving the television series, this should certainly provide him with many ammunition.
And then there is Moore, who may not have much previous experience in comedy, but who has certainly proven her acting capacity.
A shame, then, that everything is deteriorating in such a desperately funny swamp.
 "Evolution" is a film more concerned with its special effects (which are quite good) than anything that looks like an always funny script.
It has its moments (a scene in which Jones's body is invaded by an extraterrestrial is particularly entertaining), but there are embarrassing stretches which are completely devoid of humor.
Moore is completely wasted, his clumsy shtick become very old, very fast.
Duchovny has incredibly little material with which to work with.
And the story is so formula, it could have been written by monkeys.
Part of what made the "ghostbusters" so wonderful was a combination of a large script and the characters for which the public could tell.
 "Evolution" is so tedious of the mind that it is difficult not to start applauding extraterrestrials.
