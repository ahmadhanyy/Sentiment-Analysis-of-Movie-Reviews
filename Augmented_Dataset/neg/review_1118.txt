Meanwhile, the Japanese furtive attack is imminent ...
Review: "Pearl Harbor" is a perfect example of films as a product rather than art.
It is hardly more than a very calculated attempt to court the masses, seducing them with large stars, great effects and a large setting - but no heart.
It is difficult to criticize the actors because they do everything that the film requests.
Unfortunately, this is barely more than reciting the dialogue of such pure banality that it makes it impatient to see the script that Randall Wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he wrote "Pearl Harbor" with hisLEFT.
The intrigue here is a pure shot, and the setting in wartime is simply a practical backdrop.
There is no real exploration of what Pearl Harbor meant for the United States, and no overview of his vital role in incitement to this country to join the Second World War.
Instead, there is just a triangle in love with the assembly line, an empty patriotic rhetoric and an attempt to appease Japanese viewers via the inclusion of certain reluctant imperial commanders (when we surround it, "I fearThat all we have done is to awaken a sleep to sleeping ", I almost fell from my seat).
At the credit of the film, he includes a fantastic representation of the attack herself, an exciting and dizzying hour that plunges viewers into the war.
If only the remaining two hours had been manufactured with such competence, perhaps this non-event of the Memorial Day would have been valid.
