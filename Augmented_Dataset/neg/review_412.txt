The second serial killer thriller of the month is simply horrible.
Oh, it starts in a misleading way, with a handful of intriguing characters and a solid location work.
After a baby-sitter has emptied in the prologue adapted to someone in the house, the parallel stories take place, the first involving a Sheriff of Texas (R. Lee Emery), a horrible double murder and the arrivalof a moroseage of the FBI (Dennis Quaid) on the eve of voting for the re -election of local law.
The second combines an auto-hiker (Jared Leto) with a former friendly rail worker (Danny Glover).
They head west, towards the Rockies and far from the murder scene.
Which one is the killer?
Well, that doesn't really matter, because when the writer / director for the first time Jeb Stuart (Die Hard) finally overturns beans, you won't take his choice seriously anyway.
Everything goes south for about an hour, with the tale taking hair pin turns that I certainly could not follow.
And through everything, there is Quaid, playing with the most intense monotony on this side of Steven Sea-Gal.
I guess I'm happy not to have come out - there are beautiful train tips at the end and a funny wink to DR.
Strange love.
