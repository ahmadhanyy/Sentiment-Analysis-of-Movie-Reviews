The salaries of the best Hollywood players become obscurely important these days and many find that it is the main reason for the rowing of the film's budgets.
The actors who demand such wages could be greedy, but in some cases, they are completely justified, because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation.
The proof can be found even in the field of low -budget films, and a fine example is Breakaway, Thriller 1995 directed by Sean Dash and with the famous figure skater (in) celebrates Tonya Harding.
Face of Tonya Harding is very well presented on the poster of the film, but the main star of the film is Terre Thompson who plays Myra, a pretty woman who works as a mail to gangster.
One day, she decides to retire, but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about it.
Realizing that her life suddenly became worthless, Myra begins to run for her life, followed by professional assassins.
Terre Thompson being the real star of the film instead of Tonya Harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that present the old artistic skater.
Although Tonya Harding displays convincing martial arts capacities, her game leaves much to be desired.
On the other hand, his disappointing efforts are hardly moved to the film that lacks originality, characters and credible situations and in fact represents everything that gave B-Films a bad reputation.
Martin Sheen's brother, Joe Estevez, whose character seems to have entered another set of films, is the only bright point in Breakaway.
Unfortunately, he appears in this film too little late to prevent viewers from realizing why the beginnings at Silver Screen in Tonya Harding turned out to be his last film.
