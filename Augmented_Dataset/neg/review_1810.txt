It is a good thing that most animated science fiction films come from Japan, because "Titan A. E."Is proof that Hollywood has no idea how to do it.
I don't know what this film is supposed to be.
From what I can say, he is a young man named Chou Frize who is one of the last survivors of the earth at the beginning of the 31st century who without knowing it to save and regenerate thiswhich remains of the human race.
It is a good premise for a science fiction animated film rich in action, but there is no gain.
The story takes the main characters everywhere in the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil "flirting" extraterrestrials want to destroy for no apparent reason.
So, in the process, we get a lot of spacecraft, fist fights, blaster fights and more double cross than you can shake a stick.
There are so many useless science fiction jokes, it's too much to take.
The galaxy here is a total scam of the "Star Wars" universe that the creators do not bother to fill the basic details which makes the story confusing, the characters not motivated and superficial and the intrigue simply boring.
Despite the fantastic animation and special effects, it is simply not an interesting film.
