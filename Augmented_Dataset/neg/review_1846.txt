Stallone tries to "act" in this cop drama.
The film takes place in a district built prematurely by Kietal, which is nephew (played by Michael Rappaport) is involved in a car accident and the murder of two young blacks.
Keital Dosen really does not want to get involved in anything, get rid of Rappaport, and Stallone and Niro try to determine what is going on.
This film should be brilliant.
It looks like a big plot, the actors are first year, and the support cast is also good, and Stallone tries to provide good performance.
However, he cannot resist.
Although the game is fantastic (even Stallone is not bad), the staging and the story are dull and long
Some scenes last too long, without doing anything about it.
In fact, the only scenes that work are action scenes, which I suspect that Stallone was trying to avoid.
In this film, seriousness means dull.
The dialogue is speaking and simply repeating the same points again and again, no matter who delivers them.
The intrigue, which has potential, is wasted, once again clich√© after a while.
In fact, the only thing that keeps the film is Kietal and Niro, both offering their usual good performance.
However, Stallone, although he did not give much to say, gives good performances.
However, it is not so bad.
As said above, the action scenes are well done.
There is also a very good end, which uses the audio system of cinemas well.
In fact, the last 10 minutes of this 2 -hour film are one of the best ends of 1997.
If only the rest of the film was as good as the end.
COP LAND, then, turns out not to be a Power House film, but a rather dull and not exciting film.
Extremely disappointing, and I can't really recommend it.
