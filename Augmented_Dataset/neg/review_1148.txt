Synopsis: The original survivor "Jurassic Park" Alan Grant (Neill) is deceived by Paul and Amanda Kirby (Macy and Leoni) to carry out an expedition on an island invaded by Dinosaur, to save their failed son.
Grant's team is chosen one by one while it meets dinosaurs both new and familiar, and Grant realizes that certain breeds are smarter than he thought before.
Review: there is a reason why "Jurassic Park III" is better than its immediate predecessor, "The Lost World: Jurassic Park".
The latter lost 129 minutes of my life; the first, only 94.
The first "park" was a wonderful film, full of impressive sites, interesting characters and real sensations.
His two successors were pale imitations, rising from grade B horror films of one hundred million dollars.
At least, this third entry realizes it; while "The Lost World" tried to justify its existence with a ridiculous and surpassed plot ", Jurassic Park III" simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and leaves chaosto start.
There is a desperate feeling of already seen which presides over this film; the dinos animated by computer are no longer new or exciting, and even the first presence of air lizards barely improves the situation.
Remember that Wondrous First Trolley Ride through the park in the original film?
Nothing in this new recovery is getting closer.
Add an exwindle dialogue of the Buchman, Payne and Taylor screenwriters, and telephone performances by the normally competent Macy and Leoni, and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone except Dino lovers.
At least, Neill makes efforts to maintain the dignity of his character, and there is much less gore than in "The Lost World", which makes this episode more suitable for children.
