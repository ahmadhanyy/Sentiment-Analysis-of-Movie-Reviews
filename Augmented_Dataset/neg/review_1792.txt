2 days in the valley are more or less a fictional fiction.
This essentially implies how a bunch of original characters from the Los Angeles region end up being intertwined in a very unusual way.
I am not going into details much more than that, because it would take an eternity to explain, and frankly, I am not ready to devote more time to it than the 2 hours that I have already lost.
Although he is very hard at being pulp fiction, 2 days in the valley are not far away.
This is a fairly important conviction given that the cast includes Danny Aiello, James Spader and Jeff Daniels.
Although the story is not much, and the dialogue and the characters are only marginally better, 2 days in the valley have some light points.
The character of James Spader, although not much better than the others, is at least fun to look in a sick way.
And we can see a beautiful cat fight between Uber Babes Teri Hatcher and Charlize Theron (in his first role).
You know that a film is not so good when the highest point is a fight between two women.
Even if they are both magnificent.
I will give credit to writers in the rather intelligent ways of which they have managed to meet the life of this group of characters who would never have interacted.
But my wonder of this ingenuity is far from taking advantage of the result.
Although some of the characters and their respective stories are quite interesting, they are inevitably slaughtered because they intersect with the other half of the characters of which I was absolutely nothing.
If I had to put a number there, only about half of the story and half of the characters in this film were particularly interesting or otherwise pleasant to watch.
This is the kind of film that only a big fan of one or more distribution members should rent, and even then prepare for disappointment.
Even Charlize Theron being naked would not make me sit again through this film.
Or at least not anyway.
