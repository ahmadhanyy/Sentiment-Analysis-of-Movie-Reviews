The premise of James Wong's new film, Final Destination, is that Alex Browning, the protagonist, prevents six of his friends from climbing a condemned plane, thus deceiving fate.
However, fate is not so easily beaten and Alex's friends soon start to die in unusual circumstances.
Essentially, this premise is an intelligent path for making a slasher-flick without the slasher.
Unfortunately, it is practically the only intelligent thing about the film.
Regarding teenage horror films, the final destination is better than many.
There is enough shocking death, graphic gore and black humor required to provide the essential thrill of the "roller coaster" type in the heart of the average horror film.
Unfortunately, this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this kind.
The relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless, except as an excuse to set up the following death.
The scene where two of the characters enter a funeral lounge to see the body of their recently killed friend is supposed to be frightening and dramatic, but presents part of the most stupid dialogue I have seen.
If you are looking for a Saturday night thriller to scare your appointment, this film could do the trick.
Apart from that, wait until it goes into heavy rotation on the cable.
