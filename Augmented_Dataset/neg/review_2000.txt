The two guys from the party drop their heads to the Haddaway dance hit "What is love?"
While getting into trouble in the nightclub after the nightclub.
It is barely enough to maintain a three -minute skit _saturday_night_live_, but the producer _snl_ lorne Michaels, _cluesless_ creator Amy Heckerling, and Paramount pictures saw something in the sketch "Roxbury Guys" by Roxbury Guys "end of the night.
The emphasis on the word "probably".
_A_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already thin concept and stretches it due far beyond the break point - and that of the levels of patience of viewers.
The first five minutes of _roxbury_ play a lot as one of the original "Roxbury Guys" sketches.
With "What is love?"
Reflecting on the soundtrack, the fraternal duo of Doug and Steve Butabi (Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell) bob his head, extend the "hotties" in the clubs, then remove a few with violent pelvic blows.
There is however a crucial difference - these guys speak.
This little fact was used as justification for the existence of the film, that the new speech capacity of the Butabis would open a whole new set of doors for the characters.
The doors opened by the director John Fortenberry and the writers Steve Koren, Ferrell and Kattan are new, for sure, but they all lead to comic dead ends.
There is no history in itself, only a series of vaguely structured and linked sub -intrigues.
The brothers literally meet (or rather, come up against, as in the car) Richard Grieco of renown _21_jump_street_, and through him, they take the entry into the exclusive Roxbury Club.
There, they meet a owner of Hosthot club (Palminister Chazz, obviously unavnforced - that you will want him?), Who is interested in an idea of theirs.
Meanwhile, the authoritarian father of the Bros (Dan Hedaya) wants them to stop the clubbing.
When Doug refuses and Steve Dimwitted obeys his father, a rift is created between the two.
The narrative disorder of _roxbury_ would have been forgiven if everything that was going on was the slightest a little funny, but almost none of that.
The public of the assembly press was mainly sitting silent throughout the film, the only big exception being a big laugh towards the end.
Alas, the joke- a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire _-- will only agree with people who saw this film.
Admittedly, many people have seen _jerry_maguire_, but the fact that the best joke in the film depends completely on its familiarity with another film speaks volumes on the lack of inspiration of _roxbury_.
This lack of inspiration dates back to the insipid characters themselves.
Like too many sketches on the current incarnation of _Saturday_night_live_, "The Roxbury Guys" is a sketch to a joke that never suggests that the characters have enough comic life to survive outside the context of the sketch.
After watching one of the sketches of "Roxbury" on SNL, that's what you get out of the characters: they lower your head towards "What is love?"
Bosse of women without mistrust, and ... that's it.
After watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_, you will find yourself exactly the same.
