Revue de Susan Granger on "The Musketeer" (Universal Pictures)
Hollywood launches another assault on classical literature with this adaptation of $ 50 million from the novel by Alexandre Dumas which is strong in action but weak on the theater, merging the Martial Arts of Hong Kong with the 17th century sword game.
The story tells the adventures of the dashing of Artagnan (Justin Chambers) as he leaves his village in Gascogne, heading for Paris, to join the elite guard of King Louis XIII, the royal musketeers, and to seekThe man who killed his parents 14 years earlier.
This puts him in conflict with the formidable February (Tim Roth), vicious henchman for Cardinal Complicit Richelieu (Stephen Rea).
The traditional trio of the musket - Aramis (Nick Moran), Athos (Jan Gregor Kremp) and Porthos (Steve Speirs) - do not offer much aid for him to turn to the fiery Francesca (Mena Suvari), Chambermaid toThe Queen of France (Catherine (Catherinedeneuve).
The gene of the writer Quintano and the cinematograph director Peter Hyams are mainly interested in the Derring-Do, as evidenced by the choreographer Xin-Xong Xiong-but not original-the waterfalls, including a CONTROCACH CHASE at Rhythm-WIRE ACROBATIEWith the fighters who hung up ropes and a sequence of the fight against the scale.
Shot in the south of France, the landscapes, the sets and the costumes are spectacular, but the lighting is too dark and the edition is filled with mtv'ish cuts and agitated.
As a Cape d'Artagnan, the Bland Calvin Klein Justin Chambers model is loops where it should be lacking, totally lacking in charisma on the screen, not to mention the skills of actor.
Mena Suvari, so impressive in "American Beauty", looks like a contemporary intruder at the royal court.
On Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "The Musketeer" is a cinema but superficial 3.
 " One for all and all for one " ?
Not this time.
