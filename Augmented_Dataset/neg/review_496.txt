"An intimate drama focused on characters on a youth in difficulty at a crossroads of their life," read press notes for _reach_the_rock_.
I don't really know what film this statement describes because these words look like the slow and completely involuntary bore that I saw - at least, it certainly does not describe what is happening during most of the film.
Alessandro Nivolas embodies Robin Fleming, a 21 -year -old in difficulty and without direction who has a penchant to break the store windows in a small town.
Police sergeant Phil Quinn (William Sadler) takes him, and what follows during the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of eyebrows and eyebrows where Robin slips from his prison cell, breaks a window, then returns, the whole Sansquinn never notices.
The humorous shenanigans are also added to the unnecessary procedure involving humorous shenanigans involving the deputy for a decrease in quinn, Ernie trying to engage in clandestine sex car from her girlfriend Donna (Karen Sillas).
With half an hour (if even so long) remaining, director William Ryan and the writer John Hughes (yes, John Hughes of Youth films from the 80s and _home_alone_) finally approach something close.
It turns out that Robin Pins always for his high school darling Lise (Brooke Langton), who has long continued his life, and Hughes' main concern is finally revealed as a tired "live message in the present and for the future".
Most moviegoers, however, will probably sleep at that time.
Wide awake, however, is the casting, which tackles their dramatic showcases of a showcase individually with energy and skills - revealing the goal _real_ behind this apathetic enterprise: to serve as a series of actor exercises.
Such a glorified workshop can have its awards for the actors, but it leaves the public with a price.
