The best thing about "Lake Placid" is that it only lasts 80 minutes and when it is finished, you are happy that you did not waste more than an hour and a half of your time.
It's nothing more than a bad scam of "jaws" (and I think it's nice.)
It was written by David E.Kelly ("Ally McBeal") as a horror comedy but failed both, miserably.
I was never afraid and I think I laughed once.
The crocodile even fails compared to the snake in "Anaconda".
The plot begins when a man is eaten in two by the giant crocodile of Black Lake in Maine.
This brings local sheriff (Brendan Gleeson) and a fish and play director (Bill Pulman) to investigate.
In addition, a paleontologist (Bridget Fonda) of New York is sent to watch a tooth and a millionaire / eccentric crocodile (Oliver Platt) flies because he wants to swim next to the beast.
Soon there is a tension between everyone because half of the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it.
There is also an eccentric old lady (Betty White) who lives by the lake and has some secrets.
As I mentioned before Kelley and the director Steve Minor (H20), do not oppose a serious approach to the material, but they don't have anything devious or satirical or mind to say either.
The character of Betty White is completely funny and none of the other characters is really interesting, they are all idiots.
If they had brains, the croc would not have been a great challenge to catch up and they would not have put themselves in half of the situations they have done.
But then again, if they were intelligent, there would be no film.
Basically, "Lake Placid" is better unknown.
