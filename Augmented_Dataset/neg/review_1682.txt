The "inactive hands" are unpleasant, coarse and derived.
If an original thought found its way in this horror comedy, it would die of solitude.
In addition, you must question the judgment and sensitivity of studio leaders who would shed light on the release of a film dealing with the massacre of innocent teenagers the week after the tragedy in Littleton, Colo.
The film is insulting for horror moviegoers and adolescents.
The intrigue, which is little, deals with Anton (Devon Sawa), a high school labot which takes place a deadly outburst after being possessed.
Along the way, the hand kills Anton's parents and his two best friends.
Friends, also fires, are so lazy that they come back from the dead because the promenade in the light was too far for them.
It is the level of humor of this atrocity.
The film treats death as a joke.
 The "inactive hands" are horrible and morbid.
The performances are stereotypical and caricatured.
I realize that it is supposed to pass for comedy, but recent events have exceeded what is on the screen.
It is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has gone over rolled up life.
And I can only presume that the writers of "Handles Hands", Terri Hughes and Ron Milbauer, tried to make a statement on the young people of today and their values in a satirical vein.
However, it is difficult to laugh at death these days, especially those involving young people.
With the real horrors of the world in front of us on television, an obsolete pastry such that "Idle Hands" should be retained a few weeks or months to give us time to take back our collective breaths.
 "Into Hands" is bad, whatever the circumstances of the world outside.
But the context of recent events only increases its shortcomings.
The moment is not good for this type of film.
And with regard to "inactive hands", time may never be fair.
This is a film that Shoud is recorded in the cinema trash can.
