Say, tell me if you've ever seen this: a crisis aboard a commercial airliner means that the air hostess had to fly and land the plane herself.
Airport '97 Anyone?
Ray Liotta is a psychotic serial killer transported from New York to California the day before Christmas.
Surprisingly, on what would be apparently a busy travel day on one of the most aviated routes, only about six other passengers are on theft.
Anyway, they take off, Liotta escapes and kills all the police and the pilots, and the Lauren Holly châtière locks in the cockpit to pilot the plane.
The story is beyond the routine, the script is embarrassing (at some point, this Jumbo Jet completely flies upside down), the characters are worthless and the performances are boring.
Surprisingly, the co-series Steven E.de Souza actually wrote the first two films "Die Hard"!
 "Turbulence" takes place at Christmas, but the film was released a few days after the holidays.
Brilliant marketing, because no one cares about anything to have to do with Christmas after December 26.
The studio knew that they had a bomb and deliberately threw it when the fewest people would see it.
