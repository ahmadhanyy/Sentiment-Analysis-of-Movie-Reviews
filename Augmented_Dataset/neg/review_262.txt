I never understood what the clich√©? "Hell on Earth" really meant until very recently.
I have never lived anything in my life which was so terrifying, so horrible, so deplorable so monstrous that it justified being described as "hell on earth".
After all, I never went to war, I was never the victim of a violent crime, I was never really broken and I was never audited; so I had no frameworkreference for people who meant when they said that something was "hell on earth"
Then I saw cruel intentions.
In a perfect world, I would be in charge of all movie studios.
The very first thing I would do in this perfect world would be to take all the Hollywood producers who think that putting a story in contemporary America with a casting of 20 years playing adolescents and featuring a torn soundtrack directly from MTV, and thethrow.
But it would not only be your average prison, not even a maximum security installation.
I would have these producers (and all the others involved in the production of these films) put before a court of war crimes and forced to beg the pity of their crimes against humanity.
Now you probably think of yourself: "Is it really how bad the cruel intentions?"
The answer is no .
It's actually much worse.
Watching the distribution of this atrocity of the cinema tries to act through the terribly written script of Roger Kumble is probably a bit like stabbing in the arm with a chainsaw, then pour salt on the open wound.
Then pour acid on the salt.
I do not know if Kuble tried to evoke the comedy or the tragedy of his opening scene where Marci Greenbaum (Tara Reid) moaned to have naked photos of her published on the Internet, but the only emotion I felt wasboredom.
From this opening scene, where the boring actor Ryan Phillippe tries to seduce the television actress Swoosie Kurtz, at the conclusion that I do not remember because I was asleep; cruel intentions is really "hellon earth ", up there with the audits of war and tax.
