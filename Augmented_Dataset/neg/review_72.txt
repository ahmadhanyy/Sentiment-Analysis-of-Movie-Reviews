Sean Connery embodies Harvard's law professor who returns to the courtroom, by the Everglades, to defend an educated young man (Blair Underwood).
The guy is in the death corridor for the murder of a white girl and says that his confessions were forced from the hard and black cop (Lawrence Fishburne).
Watching Connery and Fishburne Bump Heads for two hours is enough fun, but the plot is a joke.
There is no logic at work here.
The tone is also a problem - there is none.
Director Arne Glimcher never works exactly what his film is trying to say.
Is it a declaration on human rights?
Is it an elite of the silence of the lambs?
Glimcher never says it.
Instead, he forces his characters to jump in Hoop after Hoop, on the Pont-Levis after the Pont-Levis, hoping that the public will not notice what is missing.
Simply horrible.
The madness of King George 107 min.
/ not noted ===========================
Do you still wonder who Nigel Hawthorne is?
Then discover his work named to the Oscars in the madness of King George, still playing in Raleigh and Chapel Hill.
The stage director, Nicholas Hytner, in a remarkable start of screen, adapted the tragic comedy of 1991 by Alan Bennett.
The sumptuous and slightly suffocating film, the film traces the madness that tormented King George III (Hawthorne) almost 30 years in his reign.
An unimportant man 98 min.
/ Classified "r" =======================
In Suri Krishnamma, an unimportant man, Albert Finney disappears so deeply in the role of an adorable Dublin bus conductor that it is a shame that the film becomes so serious around him.
His character is a conductor passionate about Oscar Wilde.
He reads to his runners, and once a year, with their help, he tries to stage one of the author's pieces.
This year, it's "Salome".
For about an hour, there is a sweet magic behind Finney and its troop of working class lines.
The conflict occurs, but it is small things - an administrator of the bus company here, an indignant Catholic pork butcher (Michael Gambon).
But with Finney at the wheel, so to speak, the film takes place gently on these points of the plot - just like the magnificent double floor bus in history.
Where things become serious, it is towards the end of the film, when the plot takes a turn that the bus would never do it, and the story goes down into a very dark alley that marks the end of a pleasant driving.
The torsion makes sense - and helps to paint a complete image of the character of Finney - but the trip to get there betrays the light and airy atmosphere of what had preceded.
It is not a fatal misstep, beware, and that does not send the history that infiltrates in the areas of disbelief.
It's just a deactivation.
Dr.Strangelove 93 min.
/ not noted ================
Mein Fuhrer!
The most fun that * I * had last month was in Durham, Caroline, during a mid -week screening of the black comedy of Stanley Kubrick Dr.
Strangelove (or how I learned to stop worrying and like the bomb).
The 1964 film features Peter Sellers (in three roles), George C.Scott, Sterling Hayden and Slim Pickens.
Their buffoonery has dropped the house which, to my surprise, was filled with an audience younger than the film.
