Susan Granger review on "Jeepers Creepers" (MGM / UA Entertainment)
This little unpleasant horror film begins like a bicker brother (Justin Long) and his sister (Gina Philips) crosses the desolate campaign on the way back of the university and spying a man dropping bodies wrapped inA drainage pipe.
When Long decides to investigate, there are only problems.
 "Do you know the role in scary films where someone does something really stupid and everyone hates it for that?
- Well, that's it! "
Philips warns.
What he finds in the basement of an old abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrible and shredded incision from his neck to his navel, plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies, sewn on the walls and the ceiling likeA disgusting tapestry.
Long runs away but now the monstrous and winged Creep (Jonathan Breck) is after both!
Eileen Brennan briefly appears as the Lady of Cat and Patricia Belcher is Jezelle, a psychic that explains the bizarre food habits of the evil creature.
On the Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "Jeepers Creepers" is a diabolical visceral 2 with an extraordinarily horrible conclusion, giving a new meaning to the old song "Jeepers Creepers".
And now - as Paul Harvey would say - for the rest of the story.
What is more frightening than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that the writer / director Victor Salva is an attacker of condemned children who registered with oral sex with an actor of 12years in California.
Sentenced to three years in prison, he served 15 months and finished parole in 1992.
When Salva made "Powder" (1995), the story of an albino boy with supernatural capacities, the Disney Studio leaders said they did not know his previous conviction as pedophile.
And now, once again, in this MGM / UA film, this fact is visibly absent from its organic press kit.
