"Party Camp" is one of the most brainless comedies I have seen for some time.
Late uprooting the series "Meatball", the film follows a group of young camp advisers at Camp Chipmunk.
This is really almost everything that can be said about "the intrigue" because nothing happens, except that the main character, Jerry Sage-Cracking (Andrew Ross), is hot for a pretty blonde(Kerry Brennan), and there is a greatconcours in the peak.
It's funny !
Since then, "Party Camp" has practically no scenario and there is no talent involved, the least that the manufacturers could have done was to make it hot and exploiting.
It is not that I think that exploitation is necessarily good quality, but when you talk about a dull turkey like this, the least it could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of insane sex.
Even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick.
At least, then, it would not have been such a chore of sitting.
Never before I saw so many jokes falling flat.
Comedy was easy to spot, but it was not all funny.
It was inducing groans.
Constantly say, I was wondering if the director Gary Graver really thought that this film was worth anything.
So, what saves, "party camp", of the dreaded note Zero Star?
Well, it's simple: Jewel Shepard, as a flying bimbo, was certainly fun to watch.
Although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of the cinematographic trash can, at least if the film had focused on Shepard, it could have added a little spices to an otherwise rancid teenage comedy andsmall budget.
