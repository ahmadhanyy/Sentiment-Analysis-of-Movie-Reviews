We are back on the territory of blade runners with this one, the vision of the conceptual artist Robert Longo of a future inspired by William Gibson where information is the goods to kill.
Front and Center is Johnny (Keanu Reeves), a "Cyber-Cours" which doubles the data via an "wired" implant.
He is ready to leave the biz and obtain part of his long -term memory restored, but, first, he must finish a last dangerous work.
Johnny Mnemonic's urgent problem is that Keanu Reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his speed.
He walks in wood in a ray forest which includes Henry Rollins, Ice-T and Dina Meyer.
 (The street preacher of Dolph Lundgren is in an actor category.
 : -) Without a credible performance with each other, all we can do is sit down and look at the atmosphere, which is rather good in places.
The VR sequences are cool, but the physical FX - like miniatures and mattes - to be desired a lot.
Watch out for these bad blue screens!
This would not bother us for a minute from Johnny Mnemonic if the action played better.
Too bad the first director is not very strong in this department.
His grand finale is a sloppy and silly mess that lasts twenty minutes too much, which went well when most of our "wet" processors have already closed.
Conclusion: Yatf (still another tortured future).
