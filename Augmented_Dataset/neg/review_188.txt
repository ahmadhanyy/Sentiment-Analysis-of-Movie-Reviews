Many comparisons can be made with this film with past science fiction, thrillers in suspense.
The soldier is a multi -cross between Terminator, Aliens and Offspring.
The problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real bastard? Not well done and should have been reduced before production takes off.
In addition to that, the action is mediocre compared to the standard action films of this day.
The combat scenes between Jason Scott Lee and Kurt Russell seem laborious, slow and slow, and could have done with better choreography.
Russell, who is generally a good actor in quality B action films, is unusually hampered by his character? Sergeant Todd, who looks more like a sergeant Toad.
In addition to not having a dialogue, his character seems slowed down, similar to a zombie which conforms to his screen character, but marks small points of empathy with the public.
This film did not make me change my opinion on the director Paul Anderson, the last horizon of an epic event of which left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth.
Although this film does not approach the strangeness of the old, it is still far from everything that is considered desirable.
