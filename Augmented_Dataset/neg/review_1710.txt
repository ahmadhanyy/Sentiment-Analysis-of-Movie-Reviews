Hollywood lacked interesting characters and suspense thrillers focused on the plot that we have to spend two hours watching Will Smith and a grainy gene exchange a obtuse dialogue and run to dodge fireballs?
In the enemy of the state, this is exactly true.
A few parts on the net, and some parts of conspiracy theory, Enemy is about as exciting as looking at Smith to talk to the extraterrestrials of CGI in Braits lame 1997 in black.
Will this guy ever have a real role?
He has Bruce Willis syndrome.
The plot is at the bottom of Smith, playing a lawyer, entering hot water with high government murderers, who murdered a powerful political figure earlier in the film, when a murder cassette in his hands.
He imposes the help of an old conspirator (hackman) and, in the end, uh ... you
know .
Enemy was one of the worst films of last year.
Not only was he sloppy to tell his story and put his facts back, the game was poor when he should have been focused on energy, and I didn't like Smith always came out by badies when all theOther additional characters, seemingly intelligent than Smith, in a way, was crushed by a truck.
Enemy came out roughly at the same time as the Superior Star Trek: insurrection.
I know that these two films are different in, well, everything, but the fact that the enemy has exceeded the insurrection disconcerts me.
In one way or another, quality cannot overshadow the quantity.
