In the series of erotic thrillers that flooded videos in the early 1990s, this French Canadian co -production by Max Fischer.
The film takes place in Paris where his hero, American author in difficulty David Mirkine (Judd Nelson, at the time specializing in losers and people on the verge of mental health) suffers from a terrible block of writers.
He managed to overcome the crisis after starting the romantic relationship with the magnificent Anabelle model (Laurence Treill).
Unfortunately, it drags in jet circles, which gradually makes Mirkine pathologically jealous.
His connection with David Powerful Caravan (Pierce Brosnan) would make Mirkine pass between reason and mental health and set in motion an entire series of violent and tragic events.
Although few pseudoerotic scenes and certain elements of the plot make this film an erotic thriller, the drama would probably be more appropriate.
The rhythm of the film is simply too slow to make viewers vibrate, and patients patient enough to sit through its entirety must wait a long time between interesting or significant developments.
The small budget also becomes painfully visible and the physical attributes of Laurence Treill are the only thing that deserves to be watched in this film.
Unfortunately, this film has too little of these supposed erotic scenes, so those who wanted to watch an erotic thriller have every reason to feel disappointed.
Instead, they should settle with unnecessary and slow scenes involving the attempts of Nelson, Brosnan and Laurence Treill of serious action.
Not all these elements are not worth the hour and half the precious time of someone.
