Steve Martin is one of the funniest men living.
If you can consider this as a real statement, your disappointment with this film will be equal to mine.
Martin can be hilarious, creating some of the best laughter experiences that have ever taken place in cinemas.
You won't find any of them here.
The old television series on which this is based at its moments of humor and spirit.
Bilko (and the name is not an accident) is the leader of an army automotive pool group, but his passion is his projects.
Each episode implies the sergeant and his men in one or the other plane of brain of hair to become rich quickly while exceeding the officers of the base.
 The grandfather of "Mchale's Navy".
It is also the idea behind this film, but the difference is that, as eccentric and generally awkward as the television series, it was funny.
There is no laugh in the film.
The redesign retains clumsiness, but not entertainment.
Everything is just too clean.
It was obviously done on a lot of Hollywood back and looks like all of this.
All of this looks new, even the old beat stuff.
Martin is remarkably small in what should have been a more role than life.
In the original, Phil Silvers played the Huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of monkfish.
Martin's Bilko is a pale imitation.
The only semi-brilliant place is Phil Hartman as an enemies of Bilko.
That doesn't say much, given Martin's dull character, but Hartman leaves him in the dust.
