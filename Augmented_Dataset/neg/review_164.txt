Coinciding with the emerging popularity of the films that deal with everything related to serial killers, the relentless low budget thriller, 1989, the detective Lapd Sam Dietz, played by the character actor Leo Rossi, has generated three other suites.
Location 3, third of the row, again presents Sam Dietz, but this time, who had to catch a vicious serial killer in his very first case, does not want to face a similar work line.
Divorced, demoralized and transferred, he reluctantly returned to his old post when Los Angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer, and the evidence indicates a link with one of the former cases of Dietz.
To make things even more interesting, it seems that the killer deliberately organizes murders in order to bring Dietz to the investigation.
Fans of British television films and mini-series as a suspicious or cracker bonus would probably see a lot of similarities in relentless film series.
They both present vicious psychopathic killers, but also give a lot of details, generally depressed, on the private life of the chief investigator.
This is no exception, but similarities with British television are only in content.
The execution and the style are different, which makes this entertainment film mediocre at best.
Useless and free eroticism does not help either, obviously making this film longer than it should be.
The actors are good, however - Leo Rossi is well as usual, and William Forsythe plays one of the most convincing bad guys in his career.
Signy Coleman as a break in love with Dietz, is, however, quite poorly put.
But she will not have to worry about it in the future career, because Relentless 3 was not supposed to be the most beautiful moment of anyone anyway.
