Can you say "dated"?
You can if you saw Rosemary's baby who, like the exorcist, was an exciting horror film in his time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release.
 "Mystery Science Theater 3000" kissed the bad movies of the past, but let me tell you that he could also make a number on the "good".
Rosemary's baby features Mia Farrow (from the moment she was in fact beautiful) as a woman with a innocent housewife and her husband not so innocent (John Cassavettes), an actor who takes an easy road, although evil.
Everything seems so harmless at the start.
Mia and John move into an apartment where several past murders were committed.
 (There is also a skull in the living room, but it is only for decoration.)
Their elderly neighbors intervene for a loss of cleaning.
Everything is fine for the first hour of this slow film, until Mia eats part of the neighbors' chocolate mousse and vanished.
When she arrives, she finds herself in a dark room with a bunch of screaming people and dancing like savages and a great evil man violating her - a prefiguration of her future life with Woody Allen.
It looks like a dream and, when she finds herself pregnant, she almost forgets it.
And everyone helps pregnancy.
The neighbors have wonderful potions of vitamins to drink, a charm of good luck to wear around her neck, and the name of an obstetrician who was in the company 66.6
years .
Meanwhile, Mia begins to have chronic stomach pain and lose a lot of weight.
Before too long, she looks like the main singer of cranberries.
This is when you know that your health fails.
The only person in the film who is wary of the least is an old friend (Maurice Evans) who calls Mia to give him the bad news - and immediately falls into a coma.
About two hours, I felt the same thing.
Rosemary's baby is far too long and leads to a gain that is about as boring and laughable as the rest of the film.
I guess someone put a spell on this film.
