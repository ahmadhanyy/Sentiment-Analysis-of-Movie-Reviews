Among the multitude of erotic thrillers, which had been published in the early 1990s, the woman of desire is only interesting because she was led by Robert Ginty, star of quality B films of the previous decade.
Those who tend not to be nostalgic for the 1980s can find a very good reason in the type of films that have made Ginty The Star.
As director, Ginty did very little to improve this impression.
The film's protagonist is Jack (played by Jeff Fahey), Yacht skipper who falls madly in love with Christina Ford (played by Bo Derek).
However, she has a relationship with the rich and powerful Jonathan Ashby (Steven Bauer).
A stormy night, the tragedy occurs and Jack is accused of rape and murder.
However, his good friend Walter J.Hill (Robert Mitchum) happens to be a very good lawyer, so Jack could even prove his innocence at the end.
Belonging more to the genre of the drama of the audience room than the erotic thriller, Woman of Desire is distinguished from similar films by having almost all the characters behaving like total idiots.
Unfortunately, this film is not comedy and all laughs is not intentional.
The characters are completely antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop worrying about what would happen to them.
The actors who play them do not help either.
This is especially the case with Jeff Fahey, whose Jack is so stupid that even the character played by Fahey in the lawn looks like a genius in comparison.
Her partner Bo Derek, on the other hand, shows that she has not aged enough to stop being the sexual goddess, but it is a small compensation for her apparent lack of actor talents.
Ginty, on the other hand, tries to bring a life in the film using many flashbacks and strange shooting angles, but in the end, he only makes the spectator already bored and dissatisfied.
