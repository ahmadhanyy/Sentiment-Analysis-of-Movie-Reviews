"Shagadellic!", "Groovy, baby!"
 "SMASHING!"
Orne the 1/4 pages announcement for this film tabuated like "Comedy n Â° 1 in America" at May 8.
Have we attended the same film?!
At 87 minutes, he seemed too long, like a SNL sketch on steroids, and at any length, it seemed funny.
Yes, the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of pop frills of the 60s, and yes, the concept, dealing with a secret / pop icon agent (played by Myers) woke up from his cryogenic sleep forFight his enemy Arc (Dr.
Evil, also played by Myers) nowadays, had a lot of potential.
Fun costumes and landscapes and potential do not make a film, so throw a large dose of bathroom humor.
Do not get me wrong, I like a good "bubble joke in the bathtub" as much as the next person, but having this type of humor being the funniest thing of your film is a waste of talent of Yuor and mymoney.
But, the way things work these days in cinema, all that a film has to do is called the funniest and people will believe it.
I give this film stars because of the sets, costumes and, unfortunately, an unmet potential.
