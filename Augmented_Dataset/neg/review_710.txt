WOW, a film without any buyout qualities.
I am surprised that someone thought it was a story that should be told on the screen.
Many blacks in Hollywood complain that they are not nominated for prices according to their race.
I think that first of all, they have to focus their energy on themselves and stop making films, which makes them look like nothing more than crazy sex buffoons.
Even I am offended by that.
Bill Bellamy is a "player", which means that he sleeps with a lot of women and their ment.
What a pleasant main character.
One day, his friends decide that they want to know how to be a player.
Why they decide on this "day", I have no idea.
How many years have they been friends and why would they all like to learn?
Anyway, Bellamy agrees to teach, and his wonderful lesson to his friends is to let them go up in his car while he goes from home to house with sex with women.
It is most of the people in the film, guys who roll from house to house, we continue to go out to have sex, while the others sit in the car.
Since Russell Simmons is producer, and as the official title of the film is "Def Jam's How To Be a Player", I was ready to jump from top to bottom and trample with the feet and beat the person next to meBecause of the comedy.
Surprisingly, apart from the 90 seconds of Gilbert Gottfried, there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in this way.
Instead of jokes, there is just an endless flow of blasphemies and bare breasts (and the bare breasts are not so bad, but the naked breasts alone do not make a good film).
Also make sure to bring your Ebonics dictionary to English.
The character of Gilbert Gottfried is one in his very brief appearance, asking for explanations on what is said.
They should have had him brought for the whole film.
