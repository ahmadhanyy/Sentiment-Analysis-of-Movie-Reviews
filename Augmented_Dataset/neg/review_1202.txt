Stupid performances and huge gaps in the Mar logic, an otherwise interesting story of an eclectic group of people blocked in "last stop cafe and motel" due to strong snowfall.
One of the stranded is a patroller of Colorado State Highway (Adam Beach) who discovers a murder scene and a bag full of money from a recent bank flight.
Someone among the group of foreigners is a bank thief and a murderer, but is it the same person or are there several criminals?
Adam Beach was unfortunately the right choice for the head of this film.
He does not play the role with enough seriousness to be credible or enough clumsy so that it is funny.
His performance is stuck somewhere in the middle, and this film really needed to be on one side or the other.
Rose McGowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always, and Jurgen Prochnow ...
What is Devil doing in this area?
The best performance comes from William S.Taylor as a cheesy (but still cool and confident) type of Drifter Wayne Newton.
The latest stop is available on Sterling Home Entertainment DVD.
As usual with Sterling, they filled this DVD with additional features.
The disc contains the film in its original relationship of 1.85: 1, a choice of 2.0 sound surround Dolby or 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound Sound, a complete audio comments with the director Mark Malone, interviews with the distribution and'team, the original trailer and the usual biographies of the actors and the team.
The film itself may not be the biggest, but Sterling's effort to add decent additional features while keeping the affordable price (suggested detail from $ 19 to 95) makes this DVD is worth itpenalty.
