In the exercise of his duties is the series of TV movies rented by criticism dealing with real incidents that have cost the laws of law enforcement in the United States.
The murders of Twilight, another from the series, deals with the case of Gordon Kahl (played by Rod Steiger), old farmer from the North Dakota who prefers to spend a year in prison than paying taxes with the U.S.
After being released, he still refuses to pay taxes and the mandate is issued for his arrest.
When the U.S. The marshals come to stop him, it turns out that Kahl is not alone.
Many poor farmers in the northwest rural are sharing its anti-government extremist beliefs, and the routine operation turns into a shooting that would leave this federal officers.
This brings the FBI to the stage, and agent Mayberly (Michael Gross) supervises manhunt.
However, his efforts seem unsuccessful, because Kahl still has many supporters, some of whom are even in local police.
After betraying, the 1988 thriller by Costa Gavras, Hollywood mainly ignored the disturbing trends in the elevation of right-wing extremism in the American northwest, and this remained until Oklahoma City Bombing, when threshingmedia brought the right -handers back to honor.
Until this time, only TV movies like this took the trouble to pay attention to this phenomenon.
Unfortunately, Twilight Murders is always a routine and formula television film, which uses content from real sensationalist life in order to cover the lack of originality in the script.
Sometimes, like many American TV movies, it creates a drama where the drama should not be.
On the other hand, the film is regularly directed by Dick Lowry, and Rod Steiger does a good job on Gordon Kahl.
On the other hand, Michael Gross as a pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with certain actors is terrible.
However, the film deals with potentially stimulating social and political problems, so the time and half past the screen should not be the total loss of time.
