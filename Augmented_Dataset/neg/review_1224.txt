It is a rare treat when a quality horror film will be released in the theater.
And unfortunately with the best friend of the man, we will wait a little longer.
The film features Ally Sheedy and launches Henrikson in a story of bio-genetics that went wrong.
Sheedy plays a tower journalist whose need for a "good" story provokes her to spy on inside Emax, a badly kept bio-laboratory that she finds herself effortlessly.
The result: she unleashes the experimental shit dog named Max, a German shepherd with genetic recombination allowing her to swallow like a snake, to camouflage like a chameleon, to climb trees like a leopard and to attack with the strength of the tiger.
Max takes a taste in Sheedy, and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological kingdom of Emax, belonging to Henrikson.
Well, it doesn't take long before the biohazard hormoneally unstable unleashes its jackets on the landscape of the suburban subsidiary which offers a maximum postman's juicy step, etc ...
Sheedy is a boring unpropence on the screen, stumbling through the huge chasms of the intrigue neglected by the writer / director (I apologize for a lack of credits.
I suppose that I was impatient to leave the theater, and in my precipitation, I forgot to take note of the director, the writer, the producer, etc ...).
Henrikson offered the only relief of the artificial narration of the script, giving his character as much development as he could consider the flat dialogue that afflicts the film.
The film depends on its ability to impress the public with special animal effects, but everything it presents is a dog that can growl, open door handles with its paw, sit down, play deadand sick.
The rest of the special effects were so poor that I found them offensive.
The film reaches the sub-mediocrity, an unnecessary film at best.
Horror fans could see that Cujo offers a better bite.
