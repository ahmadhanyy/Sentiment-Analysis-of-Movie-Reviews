Renee Zellweger embodies Sonia, a young wife and Jewish mother frustrated by the constraints of her hassidic community in Brooklyn.
Her husband (Glenn Fitzgerald) is a religious scholar whose attitude of all-in-day work on sex does not manage to tame the "fire" that she feels inside, as she admits the rabbe (after havingHeard his fiery confession, the Rabbisoudain becomes dashing with his pleasantly surprised wife - and died the next morning).
Feeling her frustration, her husband's brother (Christopher Eccleston) gives her a job in her jewelry brokerage business in exchange for raw and passionless sex that just fans the still burning flame of Sonia.
At work, Sonia befriends Ramon (Allen Payne), a cool Puerto Rican water explosion Hunky who makes her own jewelry conceptions when he does not work as a growl in a high -end jewelry store.
Can fires be far from being far behind for the constant evolution Sonia?
Just almost everything in the rings of the writer-director Boaz Yakin, starting with the improbable creation of Zellweger, who does a sufficiently sufficient acting, but which seems to be too Waspy for the role.
Julianna Margulies would have been a better adjustment, which surpasses Zellweger as a sister-in-law in Take-No-Crap.
Some of Sonia's baby are heading for liberation, such as engaging in a roller of non -Kosher eggs in the Chinese district, prove to be silly.
Yakin tries to spice up the procedure with a touch of magical realism - in the form of the recurring presence of the ghost of Sonia's dead brother - to make history feel even more trivial than it is already.

It's like something you continue so long, but you don't know how to react when you get it.
I still don't know how to react. "
