Ingredients: plastic dolls possessed in love, plastic dolls having sex

Synopsis: This is the fourth film in the Chucky series, which made its debut in the late 1980s.
Basically, Chucky is a plastic doll that can work and speak because it is possessed by the spirit of a killed murderer.
In Bride of Chucky, the longtime girlfriend of Chucky, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), dies and her mind lives in a female plastic doll through Voodoo.
Dolls Tiffany and Chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in New Jersey, where a mystical jewel could allow them to be humans.
The dolls are stored at the back of a vehicle driven by a newly elected couple, therefore in the side plot, the couple suspect each other of being a murderer.
Opinion: Bride of Chucky is a horror attempt with humor, but does not succeed.
In one way or another, Chucky groaned the crisis of mid-life, and how he should have married does not make a very scary chucky.
And Tiffany Harping About Mid Life Crife, and how she should have married does not make a very scary Tiffany.
Chucky's without suspense bride is mainly based on Jennifer Tilly's neckline to keep attention during the first half, and on occasional word games to keep attention during the second half.
The best that can be said about Bride of Chucky is that he is sarcastic.
