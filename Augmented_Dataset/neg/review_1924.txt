Barb Wire, the first foray by Pamela Anderson Lee in the films, underlines the fact that his only talent lies in his improved silicone assets.
Being the only notable member of the distribution, the camera persists vigorously in his body on every occasion, making the capture line of his character, "Don't Call Me Babe", sounds very ironic indeed.
Since the opening of the film, we are entitled to a striptease routine in Anderson, ending with its launch of his heel between the eyes of a vigorous man who was called his baby.
Throughout the film, there are many images of huge breasts and neckline, if not Anderson, then at least female extras.
That alone is enough to remove the film Babe Wire.
For a plot, Barb Wire reshapes the scenario of Casablanca.
We are in 2017, the middle of the second American civil war, and Barb Wire, a veteran of the resistance, manages a joint in Steel Harbor called Hammerhead (!!).
Known to attract resistance fighters and characters of all kinds, the bar attracts the attention of government forces that seem dressed in Nazi style uniforms.
Between disparaging helpless men and showing her brand breasts, Barb Wire must help a former lover and his wife go to the airport on the other side of the city, in front of the government controlled and freedom.
Even the airport resembles that of Casablanca, except that the aircraft in the background is a modern private jet.
There are practically no important moments in this film, and it feels like it was designed for young familiar teenagers with the Dark Horse Comics version of "Barb Wire".
If anything, we leave the film with the confirmation that Anderson Di D does not make his own waterfalls.
Who could fight and jump into a little heavy leather top without straps, while preventing their breasts from getting rid of?
Only a waterfall.
Not Pamela Anderson Lee.
