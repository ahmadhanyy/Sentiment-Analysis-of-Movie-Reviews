Yet another film for brainless teenagers, it is on surprise, drugs and sex.
Stars Katie Holmes and Sarah Polly could not seem more boring.
Their characters are cardboard cutouts of each clich√© adolescent.
One thing you need to know is that I really hated this film.
Everything about this bother me hell.
The game and the script, the intrigue and the end.
The director (swingers with sure blows) could have directed a lot of unnamed actors very well and had a Watchabe film.
The "big" Go stars roughly drowning the project of all originality.
I felt like I was looking at Dawson's Creek Episode 200.
Although the film would have always stayed in red despite its casting.
The "surprise" end was so predictable.
Since when is the sudden exit by a male character from the closet considered a surprise in Hollywood ??
Go is Dawson's Creek + Varsity Blues - She's at home and looks at something else.
