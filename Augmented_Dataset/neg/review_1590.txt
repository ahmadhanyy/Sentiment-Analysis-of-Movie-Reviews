Synopsis: The sculptrous with a big and dark spirit Britt really gets angry against his graduate student friend because he spends too much time to his experiences of transfer of thought instead of his artistic projections.
The elderly and evil scientist Everett Longstreet changes the spirits with the boy of Britt, in the meantime, and becomes completely mental.
Comments: Naked Souls opens with a naked woman, and the film makes no illusion that it is a science fiction vehicle designed to show the talents of Pamela Anderson, uh.
If you are really interested in seeing Anderson's talents, however, I suggest you jump this failure and watch the infamous sex tape honeymoon pam and tommy lee, now available on personal video.
At least with this "film", you don't have to go through the painful experience of watching Pamela try to pronounce several syllable words as "eclectic".
A premise exists in the film.
Basically, while Anderson wears narrow clothes that barely contain her talents, she brilliantly practices the plaster of Paris on naked women.
His boyfriend, meanwhile, spends 20 hours a day in a morgue trying to see the memories of prison inmates because that "will make a difference for humanity".
never mind .
The film does not explain how these two have connected.
be grateful .
After meeting the evil Everett Longstreet, a lot of Mombo-Jumbo's technobababble and mystical, Pammy has a sex filled with cheese makeup music and the spirits are transferred.
Do not be afraid, however, Pammy uses his net mental capabilities (AHEM) to save his boyfriend at the end.
Unfortunately, no one saves the film.
Avoid this potential science fiction thriller, unless you laugh or two.
