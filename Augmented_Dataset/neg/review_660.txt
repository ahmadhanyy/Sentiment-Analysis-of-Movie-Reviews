Beware of films with the name of the director in the title.
Take "John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars" (please).
If the Carpenter brand was not superted as a title, this embarrassment would surely have bypassed the theaters entirely and would go directly to its house on the American network.
And I would have been spared headache.
The last of the director of "Starman", "Halloween" and "Escape from New York" is a Western Allyed Up to look like a futuristic horror film.
Production is fixed on Mars in 2176, where humanity seeks relief of the surprise strangling their world of origin.
Six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and work in outposts throughout the red planet, on a terra-forming to make it more welcoming for future generations.
A matriarchal company.
Terra-training.
It seems quite intriguing, huh?
Well, don't make your hopes.
