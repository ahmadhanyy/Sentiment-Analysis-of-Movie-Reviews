The cometastrophe film is a good disaster.
Directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun), he tells the story of an asteroid the size of Texas took a collision class with the earth.
And you thought Dinky Little Comet deep was a problem.
Jeez.
After a large opening, in which an American spacecraft, plus the city of New York, is completely destroyed by a comet shower, NASA detects said asteroid and enters a frenzy.
They hire the best oil driller in the world (Bruce Willis) and send it as well as his crew in space to solve our globe problem.
It's like sending a mouse to a cat carrier, isn't it?
The action at Armageddon is so exaggerated, constantly and too ridiculous for the words, I had to sigh and touch my head with my notebook a few times.
I was not alone.
In addition, seeing a wonderful actor like Billy Bob Thornton is a film like Armageddon is a waste of the actor's talents.
The film is just a coil to show a lot of FX Snazzy shots.
The only real reason to make this film has been to over-carry a deep impact in a way.
Producer Jerry Bruckheimer fails with Armageddon.
