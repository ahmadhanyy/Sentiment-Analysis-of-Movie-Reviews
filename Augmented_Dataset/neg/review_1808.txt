Do not let this film be wrong to believe the romantic blacks of William Shakespeare.
No one will really understand the heart and soul of this man, except through his work, and this film makes a vain attempt.
From movements to her life, that Hollywood has a boring tendency to do, will only subtract from his success rather than explaining his grandeur.
This film on his life, although well written, puts too much makeup on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes, rather than lobster and champagne.
Well, fantasies, suppose that it was a bit of a tough writing, which falls in love with a beautiful woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) and her inspiration, several pieces develop -? Romeo and Juliet ', and? The twelfth night ".
It is easier for me to believe that it has had a wet dream and that is how all of its pieces are developing, but please save me all this useless melodrama.
But I guess my version would probably not draw a crowd or make a dollar on the screen.
There is therefore a justification in the romanticism of the Shakespeare man, when all that we have to do is read his work to find his soul.
I do not think so .
As for the Oscars, were they deserved by this film?
I do not think so .
In many aspects? Private Ryan "and? Life is beautiful '' was much superior films, but it should never be assumed that this should be a criterion to win an Oscar, repeatedly, for unexplained reasons, a filmnon -deserving will win the distinction.
Another painful point is the fact that Gwyneth has won the best female track, on a more polite category, but I suppose that if you continue to see your grandfather dying and your nephew is hospitalized - people will start toYou feel sorry for you.
