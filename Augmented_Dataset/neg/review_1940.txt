Capsule: Jean-Baptiste is sent from heaven to see is the world deserves to be saved.
He must find a sign of hope in the inhabitants of Newfoundland.
It's a little more than a television sketch in the form of a film.
It is observable and will be apparently released in theaters in Canada, but it is unlikely that it will be seen on the international market.
It's entertaining but barely a serious piece of cinema.

- Written and directed by John W. Doyle.
- John the Baptiste sent to St. John, Newfoundland.
Get an invitation to live with a family.
This extraordinary hospitality for any reason does not count as a reason for hope.
- The script has a lot of holes.
- A friend who adopts John is surprisingly militant and provides for actions to destabilize Wall Street.
- John looks like the Middle East, but we expect John the Baptist to be more dramatic.
- There is a plot in the Vatican following the visit, although this result seems small compared to the end of the world.
- Great yucks like to see a nun give the pope a pedicure and the help of the evil pope praying to a Mendes goat.
- In large part, a satire of life in Newfoundland having licks in things like the poor.
The only good tomato with grocery store (under a miracle) "must have fallen from the truck in Toronto".
- Based on a 20 -minute short film.
