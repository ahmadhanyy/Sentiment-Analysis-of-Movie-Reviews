I have never seen a man as in love with himself as George Lucas.
With the manifest success of the three original Star Wars films, Lucas has not necessarily become a filmmaker, but the head of Cheeze in a huge toy business, with The Phantom threatens the new product on the Assembly.
Only this toy was designed for $ 115 million, but each child wants it, and, like all the other expensive toys, collapses within an hour after playing with it.
The product in question, Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace (Jeez!), Is pure and simple: it's money, baby!
No one in their good sense would create such a fiasco if they knew that it would not earn a ton of money before its fourth week of liberation.
I come to the SW franchise as a foreigner, because I absolutely do not know why SW films are so popular.
I find them rather boring and full of eyes for the eyes.
Phantom threat is like the first SW, minus 10.
Nothing in the whole concept is pleasant from a distance.
Even the special effects seem rather bland.
The story of this new is an insane mess ... the
Acting in wood ... and action sequences as something of a video game.
SW: Phantom threat is one of the worst films of the year so far.
With a title like SW E1: TPM, Lucas has a big head on these shoulders.
I thought Chris Carter had done for having released an X-File film, although, this adaptation of the film was a great way to spend two hours.
PM is a long headache.
