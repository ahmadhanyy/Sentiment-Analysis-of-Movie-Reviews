If nostalgia for the 1970s has not made you feel old, nostalgia for the 80s is linked.
One of these latter sets, "The Wedding Singer" seems to be written by someone who did not live directly in the 1980s but who did not read them in an article in Parade magazine.
The eccentric modes are there.

and references in abundance to the celebrities and the signs of the time, but everything seems tediously and too obviously inserted for the little laugh of the notation.
The intrigue is the standard romantic comedy with nothing original: Robbie (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer; Julia (Drew Barrymore) awaits tables during weddings.
The two are engaged; however, the fiancé of Robbie (Angela Featherstone) throws him at the altar, and the fiancé of Julia (Matthew Glave) is a skirt speculator in unwanted links.
Robbie and Julia go through the expected ups and downs because they realize that they were supposed to be together.
I'm going to make fasts - I never found Adam Sandler funny.
Whatever his call, I missed it.
 (Other actors that I do not obtain include Paully Shore and Pee Wee Herman, make your own judgments).
The stupidity and artificiality of the whole project are summarized in a cameo by Billy Idol as itself.
The idol looks like hell, and the ravages of her lifestyle are barely hidden by thick makeup.
He made fun of a photo of his young me on a roller stone cover in the same scene.
We are not supposed to notice it, and we are not supposed to notice how silly it is that Billy Idol suddenly seems to play the godmother of the fairy in Robbie.
Other cameo, from Steve Buscemi and Jon Lovitz, give the only laughs of the film.
Lovitz is particularly good, playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain to take advantage of Robbie's post -ist depression.
