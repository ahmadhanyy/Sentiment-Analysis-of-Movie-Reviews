Revue by Susan Granger from "Session 9" (USA Films)
Sometimes you just get more than your negotiation ... Like the elimination of Boston -based hazmat, led by Scottish actor Peter Mullan and his faithful assistant, David Caruso, assures a city engineer (Paul Goilifoyle)that they can withdraw insidious asbestos fibers from a Victorian hospital in a week.
Erected in 1871, deserted and broken down since 1985, the Danvers psychiatric hospital, is one of the most malicious "locations" ever chosen for a film.
The structure is so massive - with its labyrinth of corridors cut off from rubble, collapsed floors, ribbing pools, isolation cells and disturbing surgical chambers where pre -prontal experimental lobotomies have been carried out - that their taskseems impossible in this time.
And each member of their inexperienced crew (Stephan Gevedon, Brandon Sexton III and Josh Lucas) faces his own personal demons because, one by one, their mind seems to be affected by the dark areas in which they work.
The title of the film is derived from sessions recorded on the coil coils recovered involving the demonic possession of a young woman who suffers from multiple personalities.
At a time when session 9 occurs, terrible disasters.
The filmmaker Brad Anderson obviously considered this as a horrible story of chainsacre ghosts type, but the script lacks structure and is not particularly frightening.
The conclusion is more ridiculous than convincing.
On the Granger's film gauge from 1 to 10, "Session 9" is a dark and dark 4. What I am stupid ...
First of all, I thought that the original name of the Danvers lunatic asylum brought a reference to Mrs. Danvers, the frightening cleaning lady played by Judith Anderson in the really terrifying "Rebecca" of Alfred Hitchcock who also involvedA cavernous manor called Manderley.
