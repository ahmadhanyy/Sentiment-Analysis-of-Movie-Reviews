According to Hitchcock and various other filmmakers, isolated motels, guests, service stations and similar establishments in the American southwest can be a fairly dangerous place for tired travelers.
At the start of Eye of the Storm, the 1991 German American thriller led by Yuri Zeltser, one of these places becomes fatal for their owners who are murdered during the stick.
Ten years later, their son Steven (played by Bradley Gregg), who was blinded during the incident, still runs Motel with his older brother Ray (played by Craig Sheffer).
Almost nothing happens there until the alcoholic and abusive William Gladstone (played by Dennis Hopper) block there with her pretty wife Sandra (played by Lara Flynn Boyle).
Their unexpected presence creates the chain of events that would end in blood effusions.
Yuri Zeltser, author of this film, was obviously inspired by the Hitchcock psycho, but he chose to add new elements potentially interesting to the original intrigue.
Instead of Norman Bates, we have two brothers - one of them traumatized physically, another mentally.
The sexual tension between the beautiful boss and the shy motel clerk is reinforced with the presence of an alcoholic husband.
Eye of the Storm is impressive in the visual sense, with the photography of Karl Walter Lindenlaub offering a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere.
The game is very good - Hopper, Gregg and Boyle are comfortable with their roles, but Sheffer sometimes arises his psycho routine.
Unfortunately, Eye of the Storm, which was supposed to be an intense psychological drama, deteriorates in a cheap and predictable slasher film during the melodramatic final.
In the end, this film reminds us that the original approach cannot prevent filmmakers from waste too many opportunities.
 (Special note to the profilers' fans: Ally Walker appears at the start of the film in the little role of Killer's girlfriend.)
