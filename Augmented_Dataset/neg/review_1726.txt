The original baby obtains my vote as the best family film from the Princess Bride, and its suite obtained gone critics from most Internet criticism, Siskel and Ebert observing it more than a month ago as oneBest films of the year.
So, of course, when I entered the projection room which was to show the film and that there was not another spectator to find, this notion left me perplexed.
This is a rare thing for a children's film to be congratulated highly, so would you not think that each parent in the whole city would flock with their children to see this so-called "magical" work?
A little puzzled, but happy not to have to worry about shouting children and other disturbances that generally accompany family films, I sat for 97 minutes and I watched carefully and with a very open mind,Having great expectations for the film.
With hindsight, I should have taken the clue and on the left to the right when I entered the theater.
Believe me; I wanted to love Babe: Pig in the City.
The intrigue seemed quite interesting; after the events that took place in the original, Babe The Sheep-Pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon.
But after a fateful meeting with a water well, Arthur Hogget (James Cromwell, which could have used much more) was returned to bed for several weeks and the farm begins to pass financially.
The only solution that his wife (Magda Szubanski, going from delightfully charming to downright boring) can find an appearance with their new pet in a national fair (I think) and use the money they earn to reimburse to reimburse the bank(Reserve for the moment that they could obtain more than enough money from donations if they have simply made the public known).
The problem is that the fair takes place in the middle of the dreaded "city", a completely foreign place in pork and its companion.
Definition of the main intrigue in motion, Mrs.hogget and Babe go to the anonymous city and tighten with a sweet lady who loves to help animals, despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels.
It is here that we meet a range of eccentric characters, the most memorable being the family of Chimpanzees led by Steven Wright.
Here is where the film took a bad turn.
Until then, I had a fairly pleasant experience.
The beginning presented intelligent entries and funny situations involving the farm animals of the first and even a moment inspired at the airport where Ms..hogget is accused of smuggling drugs.
Unfortunately, the story is thinning because we are presented to a new set of animals that live at the hotel, none of them is even a tenth as interesting as the characters in the previous baby.
The main subject of the discussion surrounding Babe: Pig in the City is the question whether or not it is for young children, and I think it is.
At one point, a dog is suspended from his neck and slowly begins to drown.
At other times, we are entitled to surrealist flashbacks in Mrs.The full search for Hogget cavity at the airport.
In fact, the general tone of the film is rather dark and depressing.
However, that is to say, as they say, neither here nor there because children will probably not like the film anyway.
The characters of animals and their difficulties were simply not intriguing enough to maintain my interest for an hour and a half, not to mention entertaining a child.
Another problem that I found with the film was his sudden change in rhythm and tone towards the end of the story.
If you are going to make a darker and more sinister suite, very well.
It may not be my cup of tea, but at least it is a noble ambition.
But moving from the feeling of valiant of the rest of the film and suddenly, the Slapstick final with Mrs.hogget swinging from wall to wall in a ball in elastic overalls?
It didn't feel good and was more painful at W Atch it was funny or entertaining, and the same goes for the rest of the film.
