In this overhaul of the 1954 Japanese monster film, Godzilla is transformed into a "Jurassic Park" copy which is swimming from the South Pacific to New York for no real reason and destroyed the city.
Although part of the destruction is entertaining for a while, it ages quickly.
The film often makes no sense (a beast of several hundred feet high is hidden in the metro tunnels), second date effects (the baby Godzillas seems to be a computer effect multiplied on the screen), lame jokes (the mayor Ebert and his assistant gene are never funny), a horrible game (even Matthew Broderick is dull) and an incredible love story (why would want to get back with the character of Maria Pitillo?).
There are other elements of the film that fall flat, but to continue is only a waste of good words.
Only for fans of pure and hard creatures, it could be fun if you could check your brain at the door.
I could not.
