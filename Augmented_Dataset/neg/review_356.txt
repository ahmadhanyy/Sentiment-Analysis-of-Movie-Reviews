Merit recognition of: carrying out the almost impossible task to make a greater monument to self-esteem than Steven Seagal on a deadly ground.
Review capsule: A question: After the floating baby Ruth who was waterworld, what is in $ &%, the Hollywood leaders who gave Kevin Costner the money to make another post-apocalyptic thought?
In this 3 -hour advertisement for her new hair weaving, Costner plays an unnamed drifter that removes a uniform from the postal employee who has been dead for a long time and gradually transforms a USA Nuk√© into an idealized hippie society.
 (Judging by the costume at the end of the film, the main realization of this new courageous world is to reinvent the polyester.)
When he does not point the camera directly on himself, the director Costner has a good visual sense, and he is undeniably fascinating to see a film also shamelessly jingoisetic in the 90s of Trust-One 90; but when theSecond hour rolled, I was reduced to sit on my hands so as not to climb my own eyes.
Mark this one "return to the sender".
