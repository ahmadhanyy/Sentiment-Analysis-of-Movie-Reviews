Plot: Based on the very popular "Jerry Springer" television show, this film follows the lives of two groups of people before making their bizarre appearances on the infamous program.
A group comes from the trace of trailers and must be presented in the segment "I Slept with My Stepfather", and the other is based on a fly girl whose friends continue to sleep with her "dog" boyfriend who.
Critality: the truth is that if I did not have a day work, I would probably watch the real show "Jerry Springer" every day.
I find it quite entertaining, despite its total lack of buyout value.
That said, the spectacle itself is scandalous, funny and always filled with clumsy surprises, as opposed to this film that makes no laugh (is it a comedy or a drama?), Interesting and completely incredible of one-dimensional stereotypes, andArtificial Unterrain that bothers us stupid all along.
I never thought of pronouncing the boring word in the same sentence as Jerry Springer, but this film is a festival of absolute yawning, despite the offer of various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs, lesbians, t & a and television violence(Who would have guessed this?).
I would like them to have either made this film a lot, much funnier, or b) transformed it into a complete drama and gave us a real perspective explaining why people like this really startedthrough these public forums of embarrassment.
Unfortunately, it does not seem that screenwriter Jon Bernstein spent more than a drunk weekend to watch the real "Jerry Springer" rebroadcast to complete his script, leaving us with a boring film, without laughing, unidimensional characters and nonepleasure.
Facts little known on this film and its stars: Jerry Springer was the mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio.
For this film, he won the 1999 Razzie Award for the worst New Star, tied with Joe Esterhas of an Alan Smithee film: Burn Hollywood Burn.
