Capsule: Five friends from a deer group are involved in the accidental murder of a prostitute.
The attempted concealment becomes a monster that eats friends, two wives and several innocent passers -by.
It was a real public pleasure in Toronto, but it didn't do much for me.

- Directed by Peter Berg who acted in the last seduction and Copland.
- Five friends make a Stag outing in Las Vegas while Cameron Diaz works through the logistics of his next marriage to one of them.
One of the friends accidentally kills a prostitute.
- Several people without moral compass.
They started with a little simple and innocent cocaine party (!) And by accident, look at what happened.
They have a legal person among them (Daniel Stern), and a totally amoral person (Slater Christian).
It is more selfish to leave the amoral amoral, so they do it.
- This film is strange, but not really funny or biting.
Black comedy should actually be funny and strange.
There should be an element of satire.
The satire is missing here.
I didn't find myself laughing here either.
What we have is a strange crime story.
- We don't care about what happens to these people.
- The same idea of people who are just deep and deeper have been made frequently.
If this film is popular, it simply brings a familiar plot to a new generation.
- He starts like a dinner (especially with Daniel Stern) and ends up being a full -length comic strip of horror / crime.
- There are several logical holes in the script.
If a security man goes to investigate a complaint and disappear, would the guests he investigate the first suspects?
Someone supervised for a crime of the way he is shown would be judged innocent after a minimal work of medical-legal detective.
 (I desperately try to avoid making this spoiler.)
- popular ethics and the situation gets a real snap.
- An actor of sorrow is hammered and exaggerated.
More cries than humor.
