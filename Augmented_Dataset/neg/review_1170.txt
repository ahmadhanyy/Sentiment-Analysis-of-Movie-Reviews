Susan Granger review on "Glitter" (20th Century-Fox)
There is less here who meets the eye.
Or, say this in this way, if you thought Madonna was horrible in "Shanghai Surprise", Mariah Carey is worse in this reworking of "A Star is Born".
She plays Billie Frank who, despite her abandonment by her singer / alcoholic mother (Valerie Pettiford), believes that she is intended for greatness because everyone tells her that she is.
 "You have this incredible gift, and you have to use it," said his roommate.
 "Your voice - it's incredible," said another singer.
 "I have never met anyone like you", proclaims Julian "Dice" Black (Max Beesley), the New York DJ who becomes his producer / lovers of the Svengali type.
The problem is: his signature song, "I didn't want to excite you" is miserable.
And when she escapes from the shooting of her first clip because the director wants to "exploit" her by making her wear a bikini, the public bursts out laughing.
Operating Mariah Carey, who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow?
Go on !
The script of the writer Kate Lanier is Fatous and the director Vondie Curtis-Hall has no idea how to manage the sumptuous diva pop and, as a result of their incompetence, MS in a whisper.carey seems to be embarrassedthe screen.
She creates almost when the camera arrives for a close -up, continuing her lips and avoiding her glassy eyes.
The talented British musician Max Beesley also appears inept, and while the director of photography Geoffrey Simpson puts himself in the roofs of Manhattan, an audible audience moans when the twin rounds of the World Trade Center appear.
Perhaps one of the reasons why MS.Carey has undergone his very publicized nervous breakdown this summer because she saw an overview of this Clunker.
On the GRANGER film gauge from 1 to 10, "GLITTER" is a pathetic 1.
Right now, it's at the top of my list of 2001 worst.
