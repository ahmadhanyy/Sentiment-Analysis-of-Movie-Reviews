What do you get when you snatch good movies like the bananas of Woody Allen and the hours after hours?
You might think that you will get the best of both films.
Instead, you get Woo.
Falling somewhere between Def Jam's How To Be a Player (which was horrible) and Booty Call (which was OK), Woo is another in the embarrassing genre to show African-Americans that it is nothing morethan sexual buffoons.
The whole film takes place like a black version of After Hours, while Wild Woman Woo (Jada Pinkett Smith) comes out at a blind meeting with Tim (Tommy Davidson).
Mayhem follows them.
For an unknown reason (read: artificial scenario) Davidson sets up with all Woo boufferonneries overnight, which includes it destroying his bathroom mirror, stealing things from his house, put him back violently by putting him backIn question (accusing and depreciating him in fact) on previous friends, causing a riot in an elegant restaurant and other exasperating things that any normal person would not tolerate.
But for the good of this bad movie?
sure why not ?
There are a few laughs in the film, the best being the scene slipped directly from bananas.
In this case, Davidson runs thugs, gets into a metro car while the doors firmly, begins to taunt the thugs, then the doors open.
A good joke, but a volley.
Another laugh is provided by the Cam√©e de Billy Dee Williams as himself.
Films like Woo have apparently released every three months, and none of them has never been a success.
Woo will not be one either.
So why was it done?
And more importantly, is there no one other than me who thinks that these films are offensive?
All those involved should really reconsider their careers at this stage.
