Woo's art tries to be one of these films like breakfast at Tiffany in which the public is rooted for a soft, vulnerable and irresistible woman to solve her problems and find happiness.
The problem is that Helen Lee who writes and realizes seems to have written Alessa Woo (played by Sook-Yin Lee) as neither sweet nor vulnerable and it is quite residual.
Alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the artistic scene of Toronto.
It is a kind of alternative global artistic scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings of talented beginners and resellers in these paintings fly in places like Switzerland.
Alessa is one of the most competent art merchants.
She is also the center of her friends' adulation and each party has pretenders camped outside her window.
Besides Alessa, genius artist in difficulty and Amerindian Ben Crowchild (Adam Beach).
He sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within Alessa who will not really be satisfied with the rich art collector with whom she comes out.
Ben is emotionally involved with Alessa.
 (As delicately says: "We were breast buddies, now we have friends.")
But Alessa will have to decide if she wants love with Ben or wealth with her rich pretender.
The real problem with the film seems to be Helen Lee's inability to decide what it means.
She undermines almost everything she wants us to believe from Alessa.
Alessa is looking for financial security, but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her customers.
It seems to be a high -level and well -paid work.
We are supposed to worry about the feelings of Alessa, but she coldly refuses to visit her own sick father.
Alessa cannot be described as sweet and vulnerable if during an art auction, she turns into our man's flint.
It is a charming romantic comedy that bet everything she has about the attraction of her main character and arrives at double zero.
I note a 3 on scale 0 to 10 and a -1 on the scale -4 to +4.
