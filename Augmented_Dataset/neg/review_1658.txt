In other words, unless you are one of those people who have seen the overview of television or theaters a thousand times.
I can tell you one thing now: they have given the whole film.
Why would someone want to base an entire film on a premise, then give this crucial detail in the trailers exceeds me.
However, if they had not given it, the film would have always been surprising suspense given its subject.
Obviously, producers thought they could redo "The Deep End of the Ocean", throw Tommy Lee Jones and a few shots and call it an action drama.
 "Double Jeopardy" offers a solid game from Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones, who obtained the first invoicing even if he did not see being half the half that Judd.
He also offers really funny, intelligent or full of tension moments (my favorite: Judd waking up in the coffin), but none of this can save the film from his incredibly predictable intrigue.
Half of the time, I wonder if I look at one of these over-televised mini-series, which are always less exciting than announced.
Judging from the start, the end and a huge part of the middle, I might also have looked at a special presentation.
The film stretches for a film of almost two hours with only 30 minutes of equipment.
Incredible material, no less.
Loose interpretation of one of the amendments apart, too many times in the film, I thought: "It is not * possible *.".
This kind of thing is excusable in popcorn films, but not one like "Double Jeopardy" who tries to pretend to be a serious drama.
Everything seems dragged, overestimated.
When they should have kept us in darkness, they let the cat come out of the bag too early.
