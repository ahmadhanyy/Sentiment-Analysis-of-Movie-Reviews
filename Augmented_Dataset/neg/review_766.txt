Perhaps the most anticipated film years and finally he arrives here in the United Kingdom.
He broke you. The Box Office Box records in the opening weekend and will undoubtedly do the same here.
But is it correct?
in a word, no.
I will develop more.
The story is as follows.
Apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs.
One where dinos lived intact by humanity and the other a tourist attraction that failed even before its opening.
 (See Jurrasic Park.)
Imgen, the company that funded Jurrasic Park, wishes to collect their losses by removing more dinos from the other island and moves them to a new attraction in San Diago.
Realizing how bad it is, Professor John Hammond (Richard Attentborough) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs, in order to rally public support to preserve the island.
Enter the man by mumbling Jeff Goldblum who does not accept to go when we say that his girlfriend was already there.
So, fundamentally, what you have is this.
Two teams, one sent to catch and move dinosaurs to the continent and the other, trying to document them, being forced to work together, fighting for the survival against firm companies of dinosaurs to eat them.
A fairly good idea, but it is disappointed with a slight problem.
It's droppings.
More than two hours of hunting scenes become far too boring, far too quiclky.
Add to that a terrible script and weak attempts to an occasional characterization and you find yourself very disinterested.
It becomes a background noise while your mind begins to focus on things like: "What is tea?" And "Should you cut the lawn later? '
 (Yes you should).
It is a shame then really, that Spielberg lowered himself to do what is essentially a blatant species, which adds practically nothing to the much higher jurrasic park.
With only a few creative and truly tense and fabulous scenes C.G. I
Dinosaurs (T
A very disappointing sequel, indeed.
