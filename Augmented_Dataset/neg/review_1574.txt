"Mission to Mars" is one of those boring films where, in the middle of the film, you suspect that the reason why the trailer looks so good is because they have presented all the best parts of the film: the five minutes of it.
 "Mission" * gives you * gives you a gain; but when it comes, it's too little, too late.
 "Mission" has good ideas, but they get lost in unbearably boring delivery, ten -year dialogue and the series of good actors wasted in cardboard roles.
I am sure that the director and the writers were very proud of every characteristic moment they found, so they stretch every dramatic moment like an silly putty until he loses all his charm.
The looks do not communicate with deeper emotions simply because you draw them for five hours.
The film spends an hour on this kind of stuff, building at its highest point.
A large part is a glorification clich√©s of family relationships, marriage, friendship, we have divided, we fall into a sort of shit.
There are sequences of spectacular special effects in this film, and I give it points to try to remain faithful to the science that I know (trying is the keyword here).
The sequence with the Martian demonstrating their story is strangely beautiful and touching, but as mentioned by then, we are so sick of the fucking thing that we want the film to be finished.
Large design, good intentions, but no cigar.
If you are not a hard science fiction fan, FX or Jerry O'Connell (his character is the only one to have a semblance of character), do not waste your eight dollars on this subject.
And what devil, Tim Robbins died halfway from the film, also stupidly.
It is simply unforgivable.
