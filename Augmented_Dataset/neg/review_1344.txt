David Schwimmer (from the television series "Friends") plays the role of sensitive (and slightly neurotic) bachelor who obtains more than he expects from the bereaved mother (Barbara Hershey) of a classmate he does not remembernot.
Hello Mme.robinson!
Although quite cute as a romantic comedy, the porter holder is punctuated as a funeral march.
The characters act, react and interact half-speed, which makes it an atrociously * long sit.
 (And what is dreary lighting?)
The co-scriptwriter / director Matt Reeves brings an instantaneous to the median section of the story; the film briefly takes life when our hero tries to solve his feelings for * another * classmate (a very attractive gwyneth paltrow).
At that time, however, most viewers will have fled or asleep.
These difficult souls that remain with it can marvel at the Schwimmer with sleeping eyes, a dog dog with a top cold, which can go there for more than an hour without ever changing its expression.
