I was going to see Ram Shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that, I stopped in my video store to rent films.
Fortunately, my video guy was in the middle or recording Ram Shrasta!
I knew it was going to be a bad impression with only half-factors and poor sound quality, but I couldn't help it ...
I understood .
Well, after watching it (it was indeed a bad impression), I was happy not to have lost $ 7 to lose three hours of my time sitting in a bad theater watching a bad film.
This film is really zero.
There were so many inconsistencies that it was driving me crazy !!
For example, how can Jackie Shroff push two feet of hair in just three or four days?
Jackie Shroff looked really stupid with her ponytail Steven Seagal.
The songs are bad, the game is bad (especially Deepti Bhatnagar), and management is the worst of all.
The comedy scenes with Jagdish and Johnny Rister just made me want to vomit.
I didn't even finish the film ...
I couldn't bear it anymore.
Note: But if someone liked Aatish (by the same director), I guess you would like this film.
It is practically the same thing, except that Sanjay Dutt is replaced by Jackie Shroff.
Aditya Panscholi is again the companion.
 (I was going to give him a zero, but I personally I like Jackie Shroff, so I destroyed myself a little.
He looked fresh, wore good clothes (as always), and his performance, even if it was not his best, was the only saving thanks to the film)
