If you've already seen special Fox TV car programs, you will have a good idea of Ronin's content, the new "thriller" action by director John Frankenheimer.
The film implies a Mallette Maltropy, which several groups of terrorists want to get their hands.
An Irish woman, Dierdre (played by Natascha Mcelhone of the Truman Show), hires a group of mercenaries to help her get the case.
Among the people she hires are Sam (Robert de Niro), Vincent (Jean Reno) and Gregor (Stellan Skarsg? RD of Good Will Hunting).
The assignment of dierdre groups is too entered the case while the current owners transport it.
They perform this task, but a traitor is in the group and the case is again soon on the run.
The case remains in the race, because the film leads the spectator through several twists and turns which are poorly executed.
The writer seemed to try to make an intelligent action film, but did not understand that simply because there are surprises, that does not add too much the credibility of an insane script.
The twists and turns of the intrigue do not obtain any reaction because they come at a time when no one cares about what is happening, after the apparent highlight of the film.
But to add to the excitement, as I mentioned earlier, there are endless car prosecution scenes.
They are unrealistic and add nothing to history.
Don't get me wrong, I love car prosecution, but they were exaggerated and too long here.
We never discover what is in the case, but I doubt that anyone cares about when they finish sitting through this two -hour thriller.
