Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett), a widow who finds it difficult to raise her children in a small town in Georgia is requested from the help of local authorities to resolve the case of a missing woman.
Annie is in a way a psychic, she has involuntary fights with the supernatural where she can see the past and the future and physically think of the actions she is considering.
His "gift" leads to the arrest of a nasty drummer who may have killed the fairly rich girl found in the marsh on her property.
In a city of ultra conservative backwoods, will his testimony based on his psychic visions will he stand in court?
Do they even have the right man?
What is good on this subject:
Aside from Keanu Reeves giving one of the best performances of his career as Redneck Donnnie Barksdale repugnable, there is not much else for the film.
Which is not so good on this subject:
Notable and original scenario.
foreseeable end.
Suspense scenes that are simply boring.
The ridiculously banal characterization makes all the south of being incevating and hateful bullfights.
Incessant in his emotional sensation.
Global criticism:
 "The Gift" is one of those films that make you ask you where you have already seen this story.
It is a collection of each snapshot and stereotype of the South never made, and coming from a Yankee like me who does not like the South who really says something.
For a talented director established, Sam Raimi, he is unable to provide a kind of originality to this film.
It is predictable from the first scene, the scenario is written as a scam of a play of Bootled photocopied.
You know that as bad as the suspicious murder, he did not do it.
It is not surprising that the real villain turns out to be and what their motive was.
Sigh, how banal.
For a supernatural thriller, it is neither scary nor intense because it is so clich√©.
 "The Gift" is essentially an glorified film B.
