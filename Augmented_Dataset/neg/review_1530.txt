Many, as we are told at the beginning and we recall during the film, is a true story.
Life itself is a series of real stories, but most are not movie materials.
As scripted, directed and played by the new cinematographiccomer Christopher Scott Cherot, he stammered a lot.
His dialog box is so stowed - "You know what they say:" No women;No cry.""
- that the actors are content to read the scenario rather than investing a lot of energy to try to act.
In history, Lee Planty (Cherot) is a 28 -year -old author and teaching assistant.
The film, which occurs mainly during the New Year's holidays, consists of a series of incidents in which various single and married women are trying to kiss Lee or to sleep.
Since he constantly refuses, Caroline Gooden (Tammi Katherine Jones) thinks he must be gay.
Finally, he and Havilland "Hav" Savage (Chenoa Maxwell) come together, proving that he was not gay after all, just difficult.
Sexy women can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them, but he won't even kiss them.
He is a man who knows his mind, whom he often shares directly with the public in a series of banal monologues and too cute.
Filled with rich African-American, the story is closest to Love Jones, which was better.
The story of Hav Planty is not going.
In the end, he submits to us to Lee Planty's new film, which is a film of the film we have just seen, but with even worse playing.
 "Remember people that, as scandalous as it is, it's a true story."
HAV says to the camera, but the problem is that it is not at all scandalous or even the least interesting.
Hav Planty is not so much a bad film that it is a total loss of the time of the public.
HAV Planty works 1: 32.
It is ranked R for blasphemies and would be good for most teenagers.
