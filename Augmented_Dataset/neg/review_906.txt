A large boxing satire occupied with a surprisingly derisory punch, the big white media threshing sets Samuel L.Jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to strengthen the income from the Ã  la carte remuneration is to invent aWhite competitor (Peter Berg) to challenge his black "champion" (Damon Wayans).
 (Logic is that people will pay more to see Black vs. White Than Black vs. Black.)
He may be right, in an absurdly precisely precise way, but the film does not give us a reason to worry about it.
As a scathing sports parody, the media is just that: funny, blurred and sometimes, simply useless.
As a comment on racial relationships, it is even * less * effective.
The dialogue is the best of this mess, lines like Jon Lovitz exclaiming "I cannot do caviar from fish eggs!"
The screenwriters Tony Hendra and Ron Shelton also do good on the slang on the street, although we never heard enough.
The script is not strong enough, however, to support the work of aggressive camera of the director Reginald Hudlin (House Party).
It appears as an absolute exaggeration.
The big white media threshing * almost * turns to the end, in the big match, when Hudlin tries a tag extended by proportions of Roche concert.
With costumed dwarfs, gangsta rappers and the "champion" disguised as death, only then we have an overview of the parody that should have been.
