After the enormous success of "The Exorcist" in 1973, a sequel was inevitable, and unfortunately like most of the horror fim that made money, the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequence, which has absolutelyNo sense, and for me was extremely useless, wasting Linda Blair and Max von Sydow completely.
Iutile, the stupid suite failed at the box office and has never succeeded in succeeding, although it was elected as one of the worst suites of all time, with which I agree.
To start "story", he is four years later, and Rejea is tormented by memories of what was before, now a priest played by Richard Burton, tries to understand why this demon was trying to own Reban, and now theDemonstrate in a way to own it again (maybe she was good or something like that).
Now they have to try to prevent this demon from taking over the body of Regan, before it is too late.
Some of the bad things Exorcist II have in it: Linda Blair, she didn't need to rekindle her character, and she is really terrible in this film, she brings her to a lull, and in places, it seems that S'Stop its place, and is not going anywhere.
Louise Fletcher is good for what it's worth, but she could have done much better than that.
The management of John Boorman is that of a confused and elegant nature that I really could not understand.
In fact, I had no idea what was going on in this film, the script was mixed, the intrigue was blurred and the end is just laughing hilarosly.
For exorcic fans who have not seen this one, I recommend renting it.
In fact, I gave it a high note, if it was worse than it would have deserved Zero Pumpkins, I went slowly because of the fact that it has a little good direction, but nothingother!
I'm not saying that I like the film now, so don't start to go anywhere.
Bad, bad, bad movie.
