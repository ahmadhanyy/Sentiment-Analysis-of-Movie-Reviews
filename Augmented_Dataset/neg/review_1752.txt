Everything in the ghost you have seen several times before and there is nothing new presented here.
Winccer has absolutely no skill to set up an exciting action sequence.
Billy Zane is made of wood like the hero.
Kristy Swanson has very little to do and does very little with it.
Treating Williams, resembling Rhett Butler but who looks like Mickey Mouse, is one of the worst bad guys I have ever seen in a film.
Only Catherine Zeta Jones, when one of Williams' cohorts turns into good performance.
She has energy and cum, which the film needed much more.
Oh yes, the phantom also has a secret identity, but it is so badly played that you don't even care.
The only things I can recommend are a good performance of Jones and colorful landscapes.
However, if you are looking for a fun family film, go watch the underestimated pinball.
It is not a good film.
