Of course, I knew it.
Why is it every time a television star, it's always a romantic comedy, then they say about entertainment this evening or something, that they were "attracted by the characters.
They were really original. "
Original?! Allow me to give you a perfect image race: character a) Kate (Jennifer Aniston, Friends of television), an intelligent and beautiful woman wants two things that she cannot have: a new titleof work and love of the colleague Kevin Bacon.
Her boss will only give her work if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a German sports car, and Kevin Bacon sleeps with married or involved girls.
What is she doing ?
She invents a fianc√©!
Then, when everyone wants to meet him, she tells a poor Schmoe that she met at a wedding that she will pay him $ 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a business dinner,And to fight with her at the end, breaking the agency but always able to keep his job, because the guy ends up looking like a fool and she is the poor defenseless woman.
He, of course, accompanies him.
Gee, I wonder if they meet at the end.
I saw more original things on WB.
And better things too.
Picture Perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes, and expects what we love the character of Aniston, who turns out to be a cold and spoiled dog.
