Some criminals (Mario Van Peebles and Loretta can move in the house of a rich family in the hope of bringing them out of their jewelry.
However, someone else steals jewelry before they can reach them.
The writer Mario Van Peebles offers an intelligent script with several unexpected twists and turns, but the director Mario Van Peebles undermines his own points high with a random camera work, a modification and a rhythm.
It was as if the film should have ended at the time, but alas there were still 35 minutes more.
Daniel Baldwin (I cannot believe that I am about to type this) gives the best performance of the film, surpassing other talented distribution members.
