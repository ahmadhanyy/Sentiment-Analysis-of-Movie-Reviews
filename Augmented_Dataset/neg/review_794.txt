Adam Sandler is not known to appear in deep and stimulating films, but he is always a really funny guy.
Most of his films succeed not because of the making of films behind them, but because they let Sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to walnut.
Big Daddy is the first film in which history seems more important than Sandler's comic performance, and it is a miserable failure.
Sandler plays a loser of thirty-something that attaches to a young orphan boy (played by Cole and Dylan Sprouse).
As you might expect from the synopsis, the director Dennis Dugan uses the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences, including a repugnant audience room battle and many tearful scenes in which the characters call themselves "goodbye";In addition, there is a ridiculous quantity of disgusting toilet humor (urine and vomiting have more screen time than Sandler himself).
There is a hilarious racing joke featuring a woman doctor who previously worked at Hooters, and the film presents passable performances of Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams (like love interest) and the two young boys, but the film inThe whole is commonplace and disappointing.
