The word to describe Sharon Stone is "Wonder".
Not that she _ is amazing, but rather that I wonder how she can be so incoherent.
It has a dynamic presence in "Basic Instinct", turns into an surprisingly beautiful acting work in "Casino", but has no here.
Stone teams up with the wife of the director of the private school Isabelle Adjani to kill the completely notable husband of Ajani (Chazz Palminteri).
In a comedy of unexpected errors and twists and turns out of Hitchcock (as in "Homage to" [Read "Fly to"]), it turns out that someone saw them or that it is notdead or maybe ...
Kathy Bates transforms a credible, but not spectacular performance, as a detective of investigation police.
His character is a bit dull but realistic, although his actions at the end are confusing.
Adjani is more than satisfactory while the shy defeated spouse pushed to despair.
It is the stone which is a disappointment among the actors.
How can she be the embodiment of a femme fatale in previous films and present herself as a white in this one?
Costumed in tight clothes and looking at everyone, he is someone you would like to avoid because she is boring, not extremely dangerous.
Even the threat (or the promise?) Of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played.
On the positive side, there are enough unexpected developments to maintain your interest in life.
It is if you can endure the character of Carton cutting from Stone and the scenes directly lifted from Hitch films.
