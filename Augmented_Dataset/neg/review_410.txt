Certainly, no one would rent Glen or Glenda from Ed Wood?
Expect to see a good film, but this speech screwed to the
In fact, the infamous plan 9 of Wood of the space actually seems quite tamed in comparison.
Do you watch Glen or Glenda?
I occasionally found myself asking myself if Wood had initially made two or three separate films and accidentally published them together; consequently, it is in fact quite entertaining in that it is involuntarily hilarious.
The film begins like what seems above all to be a bad documentary, with an endless and repetitive narration on the transvists, how difficult it is for a transvistitis to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them, how transvisits do notAre not necessarily homosexuals, and how the main character, Glen / Glenda is (as probably so half a dozen times) "not half a man and half a female, but a man and a woman at the same time.""
The work of the camera is terribly, the camera linger, say, a closed door while the characters speak out of screen, or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose.
Wood also uses many images in stock, which leads to non-seventies expressed such as: "Yes, our world is a place occupied and scary, with so many people who drive their cars."
Finally, there are occasional comments from Bela Lugosi as a kind of omniscient that seems to live in a Frankenstein style laboratory, offering unnecessary lines such as "people.

while lightning crackles like above the head.
Has the wood continued in this vein, Glen or Glenda?
Would probably have been recalled as nothing more than a badly done documentary with the touch of occasional inappropriate horror.
Unfortunately, he then moves away so far in the left field that you should ask yourself if he had eaten funny mushrooms when he wrote the script.
 "Pull the chain!
Pull the chain! "
Announces an alarmed Lugosi while images in stock of Buffalo appear.
There is another lightning crash before Lugosi returns, this time warning us: "Be careful.

A bizarre nightmare sequence, which is probably supposed to be symbolic but which is rather incredibly stupid, follows, during which Glen / Glenda finds his fianc√© trapped under a tree fallen into the living room.
Someone who is apparently intended to be the disaster "Green Dragon" (but which is more like a Klingon of the original series of Star Trek) seems to orchestrate all this, although the film is far from clear on this point (to put it kindly).
Towards the end of this scene - and here, I must admit that Wood completely lost me - is a violent sexual encounter on a sofa which presents two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the film and which is marked by theOptimistic folk music.
After the end of this scene (not a moment too early), Glen or Glenda?
Coming back to his documentary style, but at that time, any persistent feeling that Wood had the slightest idea of what he was doing is almost disappeared.
The film walks to a happy ending which also seems to abandon a large part of what he was trying to say about the
As soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over, Glen or Glenda?
I had almost cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film I have ever seen.
I honestly think that if I picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst film I could, it might not match Glen or Glenda?
For a pure cinematographic disaster.
I give this film an F, but I am not sure that it does it justice.
