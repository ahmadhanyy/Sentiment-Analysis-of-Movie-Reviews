It's shit, but honestly, what older American public will be able to resist seeing Jack Lemmon and James Garner as former bickerg presidents?
Especially when their support players include Dan Aykroyd as a current commander-in-chief, Lauren Bacall as a first lady, and John heard the vice-president of Dan Quayle-ish.
Yeah, you are talking about pre-sales property here and, for Warner Brothers, the perfect adjustment in their vacation niche to old grumpy men now ritual.
For the non -discriminating spectator, my American compatriots, that's good.
The Raw Star Power alone will applaud this atrocious road comedy on the political thriller.
 (They did it in mine, paradise helps us.)
For the rest of us, the film is immediately tiring.
The tone is terrible and the jokes are worse.
Forget Wit Wit - Lemmon and Garner simply exchange blasphemies through most of the film.
 (Has anyone counted the number of references of the first penis?)
Of course, some of the bits are absurdly funny, including a Macarena joker for men, the appearance of an imitator from Elvis on a Tarheels train load, and a fanfare of Marching All Dorothy playing "over the Rainbow"During a march for gay men.
The arrival of here, however, you must submit to one of the most offensively authoritarian musical scores of all time.
Judas Priest, is there a single moment of silence in this film?
Even dialogue is drowned.
such a waste .
