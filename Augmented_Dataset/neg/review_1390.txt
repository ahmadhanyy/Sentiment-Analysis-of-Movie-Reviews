If you have seen the trailers or advertisements, it is quite difficult to really understand what this film has in store.
Well, it's hard to say after watching the film also.
Bruce Willis is a resident of the future, and it is a rather dark future.
The world's population had disinfilled themselves in just 200,000 and is no longer led by humans except animals.
the reason ?
In 1995, an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world by a pure virus, thus destroying the world's population in just one month.
The character of Bruce Willis is one of the rare survivors, but is enslaved by scientists, just like most of the last living humans.
They swap his freedom by sending him to a mission and making him do the ultimate task: going to the past, finding the chief of the army of the 12 monkeys and killing him.
Well, this explanation is not easy.
Although the film is very provoking reflections as a people, our future and evil in the world, as a history, it is very confusing.
And drag.
I know that a film does not keep my interest when I freeze in my seat or that I feel the need to look at my watch only to find that it has not been passed.
Terry Gilliam has a certain style that I realize that many appreciate, and I did not watch his previous work Brazil, but this film had the impression that it took too long to say it and yet when we realizeThat the end is close because it is very easy to understand you want it to be more complex, and not to forget that the film is depressing is the only reason it invoked the emotion to me.
