This spoken and terribly drawn thriller features Alec Baldwin in the role of Dave Robicheaux, a former Orleans cop who gets caught in a mystery of murder after a light plan crashes in the Bayou next to his boatfishing.
He and his wife Annie (Kelly Lynch) save a Salvadorian little girl (Samantha Lagpacan) from the wreckage and that's where the problem begins.
The other main actors include a local drug lord (Eric Roberts), his intrigued wife (Teri Hatcher), a soused stripper (Mary Stuart Masterson) and a shaded DEA (Vondie Curtis Hall).
Everyone knows everyone and it makes a curious but never convincing collective.
Based on James Lee Burke's book, Heaven's prisoners are so badly traced that whole scenes * seem to be missing.
At first, we have no idea the reason why Dave and Annie keep the child for himself.
Nor how they escaped both the Coast Guard and the FAA.
Later, Dave finds an abuse of drugs which apparently seems clean and sober and without any explanation.
eh ?
The whole film is like that, perhaps the result of a few nasty cuts that occurred during the eighteen months when the film was seated on the shelf.
Whatever the reason, someone should tell director Phil Joanou (final analysis) to cover this mess.
In its current form, Heaven prisoners last only two hours the change, but it looks like four.
