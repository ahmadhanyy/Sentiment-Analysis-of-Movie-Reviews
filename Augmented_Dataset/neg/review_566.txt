The premise of turbulence is that I am sure very familiar to everyone.
We have already seen it in the passenger 57, the executive decision and countless other films which are good in the manner.
You know, the terrorists take control of an airplane, ask the police on the ground what they have.
Turbulence begins with a "condemned" Ray Liotta accused of a crime.
You think there is no way that he could have done it, he is so open and kind.
He was taken and was later transported to a commercial plane for Los Angeles.
This is already a problem.
There is no way that convicted people are transported to the same commercial flight as normal passengers would be on.
Anyway, it's Christmas Eve and everyone is waiting to go to Los Angeles and spend the day before Christmas.
Well, Convict One manages to stop the flight in its proverbial "tracks" and Liotta, still as calm as ever, eliminates the other condemned.
He also has eyes for Lauren Holly, a flight hearing, and seems to be closer to her.
 "The intrigue stops here"
I didn't like this film because it seemed to be a scam of all the other plane films that I have ever seen.
At one point, Mr.Liotta looked exactly like Jack Nicholson in The Shining (I'm serious!).
It was as if they had stolen for all the other films at a "T".
The only reason I did not give these 0 stars is because she had correct waterfalls.
Do not even embrace yourself!
