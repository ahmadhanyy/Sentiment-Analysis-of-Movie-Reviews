Who knew that in 16 years, Eddie Murphy, who has had such noisy and hoarse splash on the screen in _48_hrs._,
would become ...
cuddles.
The disconcerting trend started in this summer of this summer, largely without laughing, _doactor_dolittle_ continues with this serious dramatic in fault.
Although it is a high -level beak, Murphy is simply a support for Jeff Goldblum, who plays Ricky Hayman, the programming director in a home sales network.
Sales are down, and Ricky's work is suspended by a thread until he meets G (Murphy), a mysterious spiritual guru that an desperate Ricky puts in the air.
While sales soar and G become a night's feeling, Ricky's greed has invigorated, endangering his romance in budding with a media research consultant (Kelly Preston).
The writer Tom Schulman has promising ideas, satirizing home purchases and infopublicities and the nature of instant celebrity.
But these ideas would have more bites if Stephen Herek had invested an energy in the direction of the film.
The _holy_man_ at the slow rhythm is not only slow and too long (113 minutes), but a funny bore, and Murphy cannot make little juice with the procedures; cleaned both of the attitude _and_ comic sensitivity that hasMake him a star (G is, for the most part, a hetero man), he is a curiously lifeless presence.
Goldblum is actually good enough, but it is difficult for the public to arouse a lot of interest in his character and his spiritual journey when the director does not seem to be very interested either.
