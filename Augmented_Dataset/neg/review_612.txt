Walt Disney studios may have finally met his match with the lush animation in Anastasia de Twentieth Century Fox.
But to judge by the last efforts of the Don Bluth studios, the visuals are the only thing that Fox must boast.
Recent Disney classics have sometimes extended credibility to films such as Pocahontas, Notre Dame's hunchback, and to a lesser extent, Hercules.
With Anastasia, Fox went so far as to throw all the facts completely through the window.
Some can say - So what?
It's just a children's film.
GOOD ...
If you have young children, beware, because they can be significantly frightened by the visuals of a rasputin zombie enrancing the corpse, whose parts of the body fall continuously in a disconcerting way.
Consider yourself warned.
Nevertheless, the animation is sometimes quite magnificent.
Don Bluth has largely used computer animation throughout, sometimes competing with photographic quality.
And yet, in other scenes, the material drawn by hand seems to be on Saturday morning television crowds, which leads me to ask me ...
Was it rushed to the market to fight Disney?
The intrigue, as anyone who had read the story before knew it, concerns the attempt to return Anastasia to his royal family after being lost in the reversal of the Romanov in 1916.
Not that Anastasia cares a lot about what really happened.
As for the intrigue - Go rent Disney's Candleshoe.
