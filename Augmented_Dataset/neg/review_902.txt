A month ago, I wrote that Speed 2 was the worst film that I never spent on paper.
I did not know at the time that I had soon met and despise Batman & Robin, who has just exceeded speed 2 as the image least worthy of your attention this summer.
As indicated by Joel Schumacher (who now specializes in Batman's aftermath and the adaptations of John Grisham and who is not very good in either), B&R is a long excuse for a Taco Bell promotion.
The intrigue, which has mr.freeze and poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) plans to take up the city of Gotham then "the vorld" (as a strange element of Schwarzenegger), is weighted by repetitive characteristics of the nature of confidence,From partnership, blah, blah, blah.
But the morals are not the purpose of this film - to reach each inflated and confusing action scene with the next.
The crying artistic direction and superimposed cinematography make this image strangely comparable to trash showgirls.
Since when has Gotham City become a giant hotel in Las Vegas?
Only George Clooney comes out in the lead; he underestimates well and claims as if he were in a real film.
