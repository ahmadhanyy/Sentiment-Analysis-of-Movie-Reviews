Synopsis: The rich Cuban landowner Luis (Banderas) gets more than it is negotiated when he returns for an American bride.
Not only does her new wife prove to be the beautiful Julia (pretty), but she also houses a secret past of doubtful merit.
Soon, Julia fled from the fortune of Luis and her heart, and as he continues his wife through the Cuban world, Luis begins to realize that, for him, there is no return.
Review: Given the absurdism of its potential plot, it is unlikely that the "original sin" could be transformed into a piece of renowned cinema, regardless of the writer, the director or the stars.
It is, in its heart, jostles B: a lurid melodrama which does not appeal to the brain or the heart but the lower regions.
That said, "the original sin" could at least have become pleasant waste if the filmmakers kissed its trash and gave themselves up.
Instead, Cristofer seems to have confused this with serious production and directs it as such.
The result is an unnecessary and without interest of obvious cross and double cross, as likely to encourage a yawning like a thrill.
Consider the initial sex scene between Banderas and Jolie: brilliantly lit and mainly filmed from above, it looks like an extract from a sweet amateur porn show.
Cristofer has not even managed to capture the attraction of Cuba; instead of portraying its setting as a paradise from a hot and scorching island, it seems bland and lifeless.
At least, Banderas and Jolie manage to inspire a certain interest; there are sometimes clues that they want to have fun more with the script, but do not have the opportunity.
The same cannot be said of Jane, of which Billy is harmful and transparent.
It is also imprudent the Jolie framing sequence, which practically gives the film's outcome.
