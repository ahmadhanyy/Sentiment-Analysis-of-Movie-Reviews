Apparently, money speaks.
 .

And use a lot of obscenities to do it!
I have always considered myself quite open to the gratuity that a film can have, whether in the language, violence, sex or what you have.
I find that this fact gives me a little more lever to complain when a film goes too far, and the money of the discussions certainly does it!
It is not as long as the film swore almost constantly (and I mean constantly!), But it swore so much that it seemed too important and much too staged.
Maybe if a character was a big mouth, but in this film, everyone swears almost all other words.
Money Talks concerns a black ticket scalper named Franklin Hatchett (played less boring than expected by Chris Tucker).
Franklin is your typical con-man and finds himself with more than one person to do so.
When the plot starts finally, there are no less than three people (or groups) who want it, dead or alive.
The Frenchman who is somewhat responsible for the escape of Franklin to a prisoner bus, a thug that Franklin owes seven large and the cops who wrongly suspect him of the murder.
Franklin's only hope: James Russell (Charlie Sheen), an investigative journalist for local news who proves a worthy journalist.
James offers to help erase the name of Franklin if Franklin will simply allow him an exclusive report to help channel Conqu√©r's scalable weekly.
However, these two elements are completely lost along the way and never reappear.
As expected, the strange couple of Franklin and James find themselves friends at the end, which is another wasted element when they see how they show no sign of becoming friends at any time along the way.
There is nothing original or intriguing in this film, and so many developments are either non -relevant or simply forgotten.
Money Talks is a painting film by number which has no real involvement with the public.
The frivilous dialogue, a predictable and flat scenario and two -dimensional characters make money speak a reason to save your money.
