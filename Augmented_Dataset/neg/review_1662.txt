Director Andrew Davis rework his fleeting formula and the results are about as exciting as his latest film - the terrible comedy flying Big, flying little - was funny.
Keanu "I prefer to play music than to play another action hero" Reeves is the student graduate in the race, who, with his superfluous acolyte (Rachel Weisz), was supervised for a sabothed scientific experience which vaporized eightChicago City blocks.
 (The mushroom explosion is a knock-out and easily the best part of the film.
Or, as a member of the public summarized it succinctly: "Whoa.")

 (Brit Brian Cox is also on the fact, like the nasty behind the scenes.
He has fun playing with a southern accent.)

Take into account this warning.
